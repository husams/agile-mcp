# : The Agile Co-Pilot for Software Development

** is a revolutionary suite of AI-powered agents designed to streamline and automate the entire software development lifecycle, from initial idea to production deployment.** It acts as an intelligent co-pilot for your development team, handling the tedious and time-consuming tasks so your developers can focus on what they do best: writing code.

## The Problem: A New Tooling Layer for AI-Augmented Development

The modern software development process, especially when augmented by AI, requires a new layer of tooling. AI agents need a structured way to interact with project management systems that is more granular and context-aware than traditional user-facing UIs. This service acts as a specialized **MCP Server**, designed from the ground up to be used by AI agents as a primary tool.

## The Solution: An Agile Lifecycle Management Service

This project provides a robust set of tools for Generative AI agents to autonomously manage the agile software development lifecycle. It enables agents to efficiently manage backlogs, retrieve task-relevant information, and track generated artifacts. The service implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the standard for all agent-service communication, ensuring predictable and secure interactions.

*   **`*pm` (Product Manager):** Helps you create and manage your product backlog, write user stories, and define your product roadmap.
*   **`*architect`:** Assists with designing your system architecture, choosing the right technologies, and ensuring scalability and performance.
*   **`*po` (Product Owner):**  Validates artifacts, coaches on significant changes, and ensures plan integrity.
*   **`*sm` (Scrum Master):**  Manages the agile process, facilitates sprint planning, and helps the team stay on track.
*   **`*dev` (Developer):**  A full-stack developer that can implement features, write code, and fix bugs.
*   **`*qa` (Quality Assurance):**  A senior developer and QA architect that can write tests, perform code reviews, and ensure a high-quality product.
*   **`*analyst` (Business Analyst):**  Helps with market research, competitive analysis, and defining project requirements.
*   **`*ux-expert` (UX Expert):**  Assists with UI/UX design, wireframing, and creating intuitive user experiences.

These agents work together seamlessly, communicating and collaborating through a central platform to provide a holistic solution for software development.
