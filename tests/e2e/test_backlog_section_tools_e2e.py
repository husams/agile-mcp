## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** AI Agent,
**I want** to retrieve just a specific section of a story, like its Acceptance Criteria,
**so that** I can focus on the most relevant information for my current task without processing the entire story object.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `backlog.getStorySection` tool is available.
2. The tool accepts a story ID and a section name (e.g., "Acceptance Criteria", "Description").
3. The tool returns the content of the requested section.
4. The tool returns an appropriate error if the section does not exist.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create Story Section Parsing Logic
  - [x] Create utility function to parse story markdown sections
  - [x] Implement section name validation and normalization
- [x] Task 2: Implement Service Layer Logic
  - [x] Add get_story_section method to StoryService class

## Dev Notes
This is a comprehensive E2E test story with multiple sections for testing purposes.

## Testing
The testing section contains information about test execution requirements.
