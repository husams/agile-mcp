# Technical Debt Management

This document outlines the strategy for identifying, tracking, and managing technical debt within the Agile MCP Server project.

## What is Technical Debt?

Technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. Like financial debt, if not repaid, it can accumulate interest, making future development slower and more expensive.

## Principles of Technical Debt Management

*   **Visibility**: Make technical debt visible to the entire team.
*   **Prioritization**: Prioritize technical debt based on its impact and urgency.
*   **Regular Refactoring**: Incorporate regular refactoring into development cycles.
*   **Prevention**: Strive to prevent new technical debt from accumulating.
*   **Contextual**: Understand the 'why' behind the debt (e.g., time constraints, evolving requirements).

## Identification of Technical Debt

Technical debt can be identified through various means:

*   **Code Reviews**: Reviewers should flag areas that introduce debt (e.g., quick fixes, suboptimal patterns).
*   **Automated Tools**: Linting tools (flake8), static analysis (Bandit), and code complexity metrics can highlight potential debt.
*   **Developer Feedback**: Developers working on a module are often the first to identify areas of debt.
*   **Bugs/Incidents**: Recurring bugs or production incidents can point to underlying architectural or code quality issues.
*   **Performance Bottlenecks**: Areas with poor performance might indicate design flaws or inefficient implementations.

## Tracking Technical Debt

Technical debt will be tracked as follows:

1.  **Dedicated Backlog Items**: Create specific tasks or sub-tasks in the project backlog for technical debt. These items should include:
    *   **Description**: What is the debt, and where is it located?
    *   **Reason**: Why was this debt incurred (if known)?
    *   **Impact**: What are the consequences of this debt (e.g., slower development, increased bugs, performance issues)?
    *   **Proposed Solution**: How can this debt be addressed?
    *   **Effort Estimate**: Rough estimate of the work required to resolve it.
    *   **Priority**: How urgent is it to address this debt?

2.  **Code Comments**: For minor, localized debt, use `TODO` or `FIXME` comments in the code. These should be accompanied by a brief explanation and ideally a reference to a backlog item if it's a larger issue.

    ```python
    # TODO: Refactor this function to improve readability (see JIRA-123)
    # FIXME: This temporary workaround needs a proper solution (see JIRA-456)
    ```

## Prioritization and Resolution

Technical debt items will be prioritized alongside new features and bug fixes during sprint planning. Factors influencing prioritization include:

*   **Impact on Development Velocity**: How much does this debt slow down future work?
*   **Risk of Bugs/Incidents**: How likely is this debt to cause issues?
*   **Cost of Delay**: How much more expensive will it be to fix this later?
*   **Strategic Alignment**: Does addressing this debt align with broader architectural goals?

## Prevention Strategies

*   **Adherence to Guidelines**: Strictly follow the [Coding Guidelines and Conventions](coding_guidelines.md).
*   **Thorough Code Reviews**: Ensure code reviews are effective in catching potential debt early.
*   **Automated Quality Checks**: Leverage pre-commit hooks, linters, and static analysis tools.
*   **Continuous Refactoring**: Encourage small, continuous refactoring efforts as part of daily development.
*   **Knowledge Sharing**: Promote understanding of the codebase to prevent re-introduction of solved problems.

## Review and Refinement

Periodically, the team will review the technical debt backlog to re-evaluate priorities and ensure that debt is being managed effectively.
