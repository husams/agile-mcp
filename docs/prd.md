# Agile Lifecycle Management Service Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
* **Empower AI Agents**: To provide a robust set of tools for Generative AI agents to autonomously manage the agile software development lifecycle.
* **Streamline Development**: To enable agents to efficiently manage backlogs, retrieve task-relevant information, and track generated artifacts.
* **Standardize Interaction**: To implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the standard for all agent-service communication, ensuring predictable and secure interactions.
* **Support Complex Workflows**: To facilitate advanced agile practices like story dependencies and prioritized task queuing for developer agents.

### Background Context
The modern software development process, especially when augmented by AI, requires a new layer of tooling. AI agents need a structured way to interact with project management systems that is more granular and context-aware than traditional user-facing UIs.

This service will act as a specialized **MCP Server**, designed from the ground up to be used by AI agents as a primary tool. It will leverage the client-host-server architecture defined in the MCP specification, where the agent (client) communicates through a host application to our service. This ensures that the agent operates within secure, well-defined boundaries, only accessing the project information it is permitted to, without having visibility into the entire conversation or other servers. The service will be composable and easy to build upon, adhering to MCP's core design principles.

## Requirements

### Functional
1.  **FR1**: The service MUST provide tools for agents to create, retrieve, update, and manage Epics and Stories.
2.  **FR2**: The service MUST allow agents to link generated artifacts (e.g., file URIs) to specific stories.
3.  **FR3**: The service MUST provide a tool for a Developer Agent to retrieve the next "ready" story from the backlog, respecting dependencies.
4.  **FR4**: The service MUST allow a Product Owner Agent to define dependencies between user stories.
5.  **FR5**: The service MUST allow agents to query and retrieve specific sections of documents linked as artifacts.
6.  **FR6**: All agent interactions with the service MUST conform to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification.
7.  **FR7**: Stories retrieved from the service MUST be self-sufficient, containing all necessary information for a developer agent to begin implementation.
8.  **FR8**: The service MUST provide a tool for an agent to retrieve a specific section of a story (e.g., "Acceptance Criteria", "Description").
9.  **FR9**: The service MUST provide tools for agents to manage the lifecycle state of Epics and Stories.

### Non Functional
1.  **NFR1**: The service architecture SHOULD be highly composable, allowing new tools and capabilities to be added progressively without impacting existing functionality, as per MCP design principles.
2.  **NFR2**: The service MUST enforce strict security boundaries, ensuring an agent can only access data and tools relevant to its session and permissions, as per MCP design principles.
3.  **NFR3**: The service MUST be designed for high availability to support continuous operation by autonomous agents.
4.  **NFR4**: The service's API response times for common operations (e.g., getting a story) SHOULD be under 200ms to ensure agent efficiency.

## Work Item Lifecycles

### Epic Lifecycle
* **Draft**: The epic is being defined and is not yet ready for development.
* **Ready**: The epic has been approved and its stories can be prioritized for development.
* **In Progress**: At least one story within the epic is being actively worked on.
* **Done**: All stories within the epic are complete.
* **On Hold**: The epic is temporarily paused.

### Story Lifecycle
* **ToDo**: The story is approved and waiting in the backlog.
* **InProgress**: The story is actively being worked on by a developer agent.
* **Review**: The work is complete and pending a QA review.
* **Done**: The story has been implemented, reviewed, and is considered complete.

---

## Technical Assumptions

* **Repository Structure**: A **Monorepo** structure is recommended to manage the service's packages and potentially shared types with future client implementations.
* **Service Architecture**: A **Monolithic Service** approach is recommended. This aligns with the architecture document and prioritizes simplicity for a locally hosted service.
* **Testing Requirements**: A comprehensive testing strategy is required, as formally defined in the "Testing Strategy" section of the **Architecture Document**. This includes Unit, Integration, and End-to-End tests to ensure the reliability of the tools provided to the agents.

---

## Epic List

Here is the proposed high-level list of epics to build the service. Please review the overall structure.

* **Epic 1: Core Service & Backlog Management**: Establish the foundational MCP server, implement core data models, and provide basic tools for managing epics and stories, including their lifecycles.
* **Epic 2: Artifact & Context Management**: Implement functionality for agents to link and retrieve artifacts, including the ability to query specific sections of documents and stories.
* **Epic 3: Advanced Story Workflow**: Introduce story dependencies and the intelligent "next ready story" tool for developer agents.
* **Epic 4: DevOps & Observability**: Establish a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and implement structured logging for service monitoring.
