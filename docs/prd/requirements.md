# Requirements

## Functional
1.  **FR1**: The service MUST provide tools for agents to create, retrieve, update, and manage Epics and Stories.
2.  **FR2**: The service MUST allow agents to link generated artifacts (e.g., file URIs) to specific stories.
3.  **FR3**: The service MUST provide a tool for a Developer Agent to retrieve the next "ready" story from the backlog, respecting dependencies.
4.  **FR4**: The service MUST allow a Product Owner Agent to define dependencies between user stories.
5.  **FR5**: The service MUST allow agents to query and retrieve specific sections of documents linked as artifacts.
6.  **FR6**: All agent interactions with the service MUST conform to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification.
7.  **FR7**: Stories retrieved from the service MUST be self-sufficient, containing all necessary information for a developer agent to begin implementation.
8.  **FR8**: The service MUST provide a tool for an agent to retrieve a specific section of a story (e.g., "Acceptance Criteria", "Description").
9.  **FR9**: The service MUST provide tools for agents to manage the lifecycle state of Epics and Stories.

## Non Functional
1.  **NFR1**: The service architecture SHOULD be highly composable, allowing new tools and capabilities to be added progressively without impacting existing functionality, as per MCP design principles.
2.  **NFR2**: The service MUST enforce strict security boundaries, ensuring an agent can only access data and tools relevant to its session and permissions, as per MCP design principles.
3.  **NFR3**: The service MUST be designed for high availability to support continuous operation by autonomous agents.
4.  **NFR4**: The service's API response times for common operations (e.g., getting a story) SHOULD be under 200ms to ensure agent efficiency.
