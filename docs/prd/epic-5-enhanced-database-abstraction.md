# Epic 5: Enhanced Database Abstraction

This epic focuses on decoupling the application from SQLite, allowing for support of various database backends, including relational, document-based, and graph databases.

### Story 5.1: Database Abstraction Layer

**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** the database interactions to be abstracted,
**so that** the service can support different database technologies without significant code changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A clear abstraction layer is defined for database operations.
2.  Existing data models and repository methods are adapted to use this abstraction.
3.  The service can still function with SQLite using the new abstraction.

### Story 5.2: PostgreSQL Database Integration

**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** the service to support PostgreSQL as a database backend,
**so that** the service can handle larger datasets and more complex queries.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The service can connect to and use a PostgreSQL database.
2.  All existing data (Epics, Stories, Artifacts, Dependencies) can be persisted and retrieved from PostgreSQL.
3.  Database migrations for PostgreSQL are defined and executable.

### Story 5.3: Document Database Integration (e.g., MongoDB)

**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** the service to support a document-based database (e.g., MongoDB) as a backend,
**so that** the service can store and retrieve unstructured or semi-structured data more flexibly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The service can connect to and use a document database.
2.  Epics and Stories can be stored and retrieved as documents.
3.  A clear strategy for mapping relational concepts to document models is implemented.

### Story 5.4: Graph Database Integration (e.g., Neo4j)

**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** the service to support a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) as a backend,
**so that** the service can efficiently manage and query complex relationships between entities like stories and artifacts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The service can connect to and use a graph database.
2.  Dependencies between stories and links to artifacts are represented as graph relationships.
3.  Queries for `getNextReadyStory` and `listForStory` leverage graph traversal capabilities.
