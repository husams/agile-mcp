# Technical Assumptions

* **Repository Structure**: A **Monorepo** structure is recommended to manage the service's packages and potentially shared types with future client implementations.
* **Service Architecture**: A **Monolithic Service** approach is recommended. This aligns with the architecture document and prioritizes simplicity for a locally hosted service.
* **Testing Requirements**: A comprehensive testing strategy is required, as formally defined in the "Testing Strategy" section of the **Architecture Document**. This includes Unit, Integration, and End-to-End tests to ensure the reliability of the tools provided to the agents.
