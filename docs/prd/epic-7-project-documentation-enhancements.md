# Epic 7: Project Documentation Enhancements

This epic focuses on making the newly created documentation files (configuration, coding guidelines, technical debt) easily discoverable from the project's main entry point.

## Story 7.1: Link New Documentation in README

**As a** Developer,
**I want** the new documentation files (`configuration.md`, `coding_guidelines.md`, `technical_debt.md`) to be linked from the `README.md`,
**so that** they are easily discoverable from the project's entry point.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The `README.md` file is updated to include a new section or update an existing section with links to:
    *   `docs/configuration.md`
    *   `docs/coding_guidelines.md`
    *   `docs/technical_debt.md`
2.  The links are functional and point to the correct files.

**Note:** Architecture integration (originally Story 7.2) is already complete - the architecture documentation includes links to all three files.
