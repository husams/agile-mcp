# Epic 7: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This epic focuses on implementing user roles and permissions to control access to tools and data within the Agile MCP Server, ensuring secure and appropriate interactions for different types of AI agents.

### Story 7.1: User and Role Management

**As an** Administrator Agent,
**I want** to create and manage users and assign them specific roles (e.g., Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer),
**so that** I can define different levels of access within the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Tools are available to create, retrieve, update, and delete users.
2.  Tools are available to define and assign roles to users.
3.  Predefined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer, QA, Architect, Analyst, Orchestrator) are available.

### Story 7.2: Define and Enforce Permissions

**As an** Administrator Agent,
**I want** to define granular permissions for each role, specifying which tools and data they can access or modify,
**so that** I can enforce security boundaries and ensure agents only perform authorized actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A permission model is implemented that maps roles to specific tool access and data modification rights.
2.  The API layer enforces these permissions for every incoming MCP request.
3.  Unauthorized access attempts result in appropriate JSON-RPC error responses.

### Story 7.3: Integrate RBAC with Existing Tools

**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** existing tools (e.g., `backlog.createStory`, `artifacts.linkToStory`) to respect the new RBAC system,
**so that** only authorized agents can perform specific actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  All existing MCP tools are integrated with the RBAC system.
2.  A Product Owner Agent can only use tools designated for POs (e.g., `backlog.addDependency`).
3.  A Developer Agent can only use tools designated for Developers (e.g., `backlog.getNextReadyStory`).
