# Epic 6: Advanced Story Structure & BMAD Method Alignment

This epic focuses on enriching the story data model to support more granular details like tasks, acceptance criteria, and comments, aligning with the BMAD method for more structured story management.

### Story 6.1: Integrate Story Tasks

**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** to define and manage individual tasks within a user story,
**so that** I can break down the work into smaller, trackable units.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The Story data model is extended to include a list of tasks.
2.  Tools are available to add, update, and mark tasks as complete within a story.
3.  `backlog.getStory` returns the tasks associated with a story.

### Story 6.2: Structured Acceptance Criteria

**As a** Product Owner Agent,
**I want** to define acceptance criteria as structured, individual items within a story,
**so that** each criterion can be independently verified and tracked.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The Story data model is extended to include a structured list of acceptance criteria.
2.  Tools are available to add, update, and mark acceptance criteria as met.
3.  `backlog.getStory` returns the structured acceptance criteria.

### Story 6.3: Add Story Comments

**As an** AI Agent,
**I want** to add comments to a user story,
**so that** I can provide additional context, ask questions, or record discussions related to the story.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The Story data model is extended to include a list of comments.
2.  Tools are available to add comments to a story.
3.  `backlog.getStory` returns the comments associated with a story.

### Story 6.4: Update Story Tools for New Structure

**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** the existing story management tools to seamlessly interact with the new structured story data (tasks, acceptance criteria, comments),
**so that** I can continue to manage stories effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  `backlog.createStory` and `backlog.updateStory` tools are updated to support the new structured fields.
2.  `backlog.getStory` correctly retrieves and formats the new structured data.
3.  All existing story-related functionalities (e.g., status updates, dependencies) continue to work with the new structure.
