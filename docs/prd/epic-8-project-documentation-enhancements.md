# Epic 8: Project Documentation Enhancements

This epic focuses on integrating the newly created documentation files (configuration, coding guidelines, technical debt) into the project's main documentation, making them easily discoverable and accessible.

### Story 8.1: Link New Documentation in README

**As a** Developer,
**I want** the new documentation files (`configuration.md`, `coding_guidelines.md`, `technical_debt.md`) to be linked from the `README.md`,
**so that** they are easily discoverable from the project's entry point.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The `README.md` file is updated to include a new section or update an existing section with links to:
    *   `docs/configuration.md`
    *   `docs/coding_guidelines.md`
    *   `docs/technical_debt.md`
2.  The links are functional and point to the correct files.

### Story 8.2: Integrate New Documentation into Architecture Overview

**As a** Developer,
**I want** the new documentation files to be referenced and integrated into the `docs/architecture.md` where appropriate,
**so that** the architecture overview provides a comprehensive view of the project's structure and practices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  `docs/architecture.md` is reviewed and updated to include relevant references or summaries of:
    *   Configuration management principles.
    *   Key coding guidelines and their impact on architecture.
    *   The approach to managing technical debt.
2.  The integration is seamless and enhances the overall clarity of the architecture document.
