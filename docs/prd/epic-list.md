# Epic List

Here is the proposed high-level list of epics to build the service. Please review the overall structure.

* **Epic 1: Core Service & Backlog Management**: Establish the foundational MCP server, implement core data models, and provide basic tools for managing epics and stories, including their lifecycles.
* **Epic 2: Artifact & Context Management**: Implement functionality for agents to link and retrieve artifacts, including the ability to query specific sections of documents and stories.
* **Epic 3: Advanced Story Workflow**: Introduce story dependencies and the intelligent "next ready story" tool for developer agents.
* **Epic 4: DevOps & Observability**: Establish a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and implement structured logging for service monitoring.
*   **Epic 5: Enhanced Database Abstraction**: Decouple the application from SQLite, allowing for different database backends (e.g., PostgreSQL, Document, Graph).
*   **Epic 6: Advanced Story Structure & BMAD Method Alignment**: Enrich the story data model to support more granular details like tasks, acceptance criteria, and comments, aligning with the BMAD method.
*   **Epic 7: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement user roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, etc.) and permissions to control access to tools and data.
*   **Epic 8: Project Documentation Enhancements**: Integrate newly created documentation files (configuration, coding guidelines, technical debt) into the project's main documentation.
