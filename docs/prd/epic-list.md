# Epic List

Here is the proposed high-level list of epics to build the service. Please review the overall structure.

* **Epic 1: Core Service & Backlog Management**: Establish the foundational MCP server, implement core data models, and provide basic tools for managing epics and stories, including their lifecycles.
* **Epic 2: Artifact & Context Management**: Implement functionality for agents to link and retrieve artifacts, including the ability to query specific sections of documents and stories.
* **Epic 3: Advanced Story Workflow**: Introduce story dependencies and the intelligent "next ready story" tool for developer agents.
* **Epic 4: DevOps & Observability**: Establish a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and implement structured logging for service monitoring.
* **Epic 5: E2E Test Failure Remediation & Database Isolation**: Implement comprehensive database isolation solution to eliminate critical E2E test failures and achieve bulletproof test reliability. Focus on fixing 4 failing E2E tests, creating test-only DatabaseManager, and achieving 100% test pass rate with 10x performance improvement.
