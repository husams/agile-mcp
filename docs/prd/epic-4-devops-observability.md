# Epic 4: DevOps & Observability

This epic focuses on ensuring the project is maintainable and deployable by establishing a CI/CD pipeline and implementing basic monitoring.

## Story 4.1: Setup CI/CD Pipeline
**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** to set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions,
**so that** all tests are automatically run on every push to the main branch.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A GitHub Actions workflow file is created in `.github/workflows/`.
2.  The workflow triggers on every `push` event to the `main` branch.
3.  The workflow installs Python and all project dependencies.
4.  The workflow executes the entire `pytest` suite.
5.  The build fails if any of the tests fail.

## Story 4.2: Implement Structured Logging
**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** to implement structured logging throughout the service,
**so that** I can easily parse and analyze log output for debugging and monitoring.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A logging library that supports structured output (e.g., JSON) is added to the project.
2.  The application is configured to output logs in a structured format.
3.  Key events in the service layer (e.g., story creation, status updates) are logged with relevant context (e.g., story ID).
4.  Errors in the API/Tool layer are logged with their associated request ID and error details.
