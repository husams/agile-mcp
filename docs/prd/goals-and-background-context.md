# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* **Empower AI Agents**: To provide a robust set of tools for Generative AI agents to autonomously manage the agile software development lifecycle.
* **Streamline Development**: To enable agents to efficiently manage backlogs, retrieve task-relevant information, and track generated artifacts.
* **Standardize Interaction**: To implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the standard for all agent-service communication, ensuring predictable and secure interactions.
* **Support Complex Workflows**: To facilitate advanced agile practices like story dependencies and prioritized task queuing for developer agents.

## Background Context
The modern software development process, especially when augmented by AI, requires a new layer of tooling. AI agents need a structured way to interact with project management systems that is more granular and context-aware than traditional user-facing UIs.

This service will act as a specialized **MCP Server**, designed from the ground up to be used by AI agents as a primary tool. It will leverage the client-host-server architecture defined in the MCP specification, where the agent (client) communicates through a host application to our service. This ensures that the agent operates within secure, well-defined boundaries, only accessing the project information it is permitted to, without having visibility into the entire conversation or other servers. The service will be composable and easy to build upon, adhering to MCP's core design principles.
