# Epic 3: Advanced Story Workflow

This epic introduces sophisticated workflow management, allowing for dependencies between stories and enabling developer agents to pull work from an intelligent queue.

## Story 3.1: Define Story Dependencies
**As a** Product Owner Agent,
**I want** to define a dependency between two stories, where one must be completed before the other can be started,
**so that** I can ensure a logical and technically sound order of implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A `backlog.addDependency` tool is available.
2.  The tool accepts a story ID and the ID of the story it depends on.
3.  The dependency is persisted correctly.
4.  The tool prevents the creation of circular dependencies (e.g., Story A depends on B, and B depends on A).

## Story 3.2: Get Next Ready Story
**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** to request the next story that is ready for implementation,
**so that** I can work on the highest-priority task that is not blocked by any dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A `backlog.getNextReadyStory` tool is available.
2.  The tool returns the highest-priority story with a "ToDo" status that has no incomplete dependencies.
3.  If multiple stories are ready, the one with the earliest creation date is returned.
4.  If no stories are ready, the tool returns a null or empty response.
5.  When a story is retrieved via this tool, its status is automatically updated to "InProgress".
