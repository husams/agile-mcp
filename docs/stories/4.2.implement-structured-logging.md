## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.1 completion: The CI/CD pipeline is now operational with Python 3.11, pytest ~8.2.2, and comprehensive test coverage across unit, integration, and E2E levels. The project follows a 3-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns. Logging implementation should integrate seamlessly with the existing CI pipeline and testing infrastructure.

### Tech Stack & Dependencies
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python ~3.11
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest ~8.2.2
- **MCP SDK**: FastMCP (Latest)
- **Database**: SQLite ~3.37+ (local, file-based)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy ~2.0
- **Dependencies**: Managed via requirements.txt file

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns]
- **Monolithic Service**: Single deployable unit - logging should be centralized and consistent
- **3-Layer Architecture**:
  1. **API/Tool Layer**: FastMCP tool implementations - requires error logging with request context
  2. **Service/Business Logic Layer**: Core application logic - requires business event logging
  3. **Data Access/Repository Layer**: SQLite database interactions - may need query logging
- **Repository Pattern**: Decoupled data access for better testability

### Data Models and Context Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
Logging should include relevant entity context:
- **Epic**: Include epic ID, title, status changes in logs
- **Story**: Include story ID, title, status changes, epic relationship in logs
- **Artifact**: Include artifact ID, URI, story relationship in logs
- **Story Dependencies**: Include dependent/prerequisite story IDs in logs

### Error Handling Context for Logging
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- **Custom Exceptions**: Service Layer defines custom exceptions (StoryNotFoundError, CircularDependencyError)
- **Exception Translation**: API/Tool Layer translates to MCP errors - this translation should be logged
- **Error Context**: Logs should capture both the original service exception and the MCP error response

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: Current project structure and architecture/mcp-server-implementation-examples.md]
- **Logging Configuration**: `src/agile_mcp/utils/logging_config.py` - New logging setup module
- **Service Layer Files to Modify**:
  - `src/agile_mcp/services/story_service.py` - Add story lifecycle logging
  - `src/agile_mcp/services/epic_service.py` - Add epic lifecycle logging
  - `src/agile_mcp/services/artifact_service.py` - Add artifact management logging
  - `src/agile_mcp/services/dependency_service.py` - Add dependency operations logging
- **API Layer Files to Modify**:
  - `src/agile_mcp/api/story_tools.py` - Add error and request logging
  - `src/agile_mcp/api/epic_tools.py` - Add error and request logging
  - `src/agile_mcp/api/artifact_tools.py` - Add error and request logging
  - `src/agile_mcp/api/backlog_tools.py` - Add error and request logging
- **Main Application**: `src/agile_mcp/main.py` - Initialize logging configuration
- **Dependencies**: `requirements.txt` - Add structured logging library

### Structured Logging Library Selection
Recommended libraries for Python structured logging:
- **structlog**: Highly configurable, excellent for structured logging with processors
- **python-json-logger**: Simple JSON formatter for standard Python logging
- **loguru**: Modern logging library with built-in JSON support

Based on project needs, **structlog** is recommended for its flexibility and integration with existing Python logging.

### Logging Configuration Requirements
- **Format**: JSON structure for easy parsing and analysis
- **Output**: stderr for E2E test compatibility (stdout reserved for MCP JSON-RPC)
- **Log Levels**: Configurable levels (INFO for business events, ERROR for exceptions)
- **Context**: Include timestamps, log level, module, function, and relevant entity IDs
- **Request Tracing**: Include request IDs for API layer operations

### Service Layer Logging Events
Key events requiring logging:
- **Story Operations**: Create, update status, retrieve, section parsing
- **Epic Operations**: Create, update status, retrieve
- **Artifact Operations**: Link to story, retrieve by story
- **Dependency Operations**: Define dependencies, resolve next ready story
- **Database Operations**: Consider logging significant query operations

### API Layer Error Logging Requirements
Error logging should capture:
- **Request Context**: MCP tool name, parameters
- **Error Details**: Exception type, message, stack trace
- **Response Context**: MCP error code and message sent to client
- **Request ID**: Unique identifier for tracking requests (if available in FastMCP)

### Testing Standards for Logging Implementation
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Framework**: Pytest ~8.2.2
- **Test Locations**: `tests/unit/test_logging_config.py` and logging tests in existing test files
- **Testing Approach**:
  - **Unit Tests**: Mock logging calls to verify correct log messages and context
  - **Integration Tests**: Verify logging works with actual service operations
  - **E2E Tests**: Ensure logging to stderr doesn't interfere with JSON-RPC on stdout
- **Log Verification**: Use pytest fixtures to capture and assert log content
- **Test Standards**: Maintain 100% pass rate required for CI success

### Technical Constraints
- **No External Dependencies**: Logging should work with local SQLite setup
- **MCP Protocol Compatibility**: Logs must go to stderr to avoid interfering with JSON-RPC on stdout
- **Performance**: Structured logging should not significantly impact service performance
- **Python Version**: Must work with Python ~3.11
- **CI Integration**: Logging should provide useful debugging information in CI pipeline

### Security Considerations
- **No Sensitive Data**: Avoid logging sensitive information like database connection strings
- **Data Privacy**: Log entity IDs but be cautious about logging full content
- **Error Sanitization**: Ensure error logs don't expose internal system details to unauthorized users

### Testing

#### **MANDATORY TESTING EXECUTION**
**CRITICAL**: Before marking this story complete, developer MUST:
- **Execute**: `pytest tests/` to run full test suite
- **Verify**: 100% pass rate required - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **Test Logging**: Verify structured logs are generated in expected JSON format
- **Test E2E Compatibility**: Ensure E2E tests still pass with logging enabled
- **Document**: Log examples and configuration in Dev Agent Record

#### Testing Standards for Developer
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Framework**: Pytest ~8.2.2
- **Test File Locations**:
  - Unit tests: `tests/unit/`
  - Integration tests: `tests/integration/`
  - End-to-end tests: `tests/e2e/`
- **Test Command**: Run `pytest tests/` to execute full test suite
- **Pass Requirement**: 100% pass rate required before story completion

#### Testing Requirements for This Story
**Structured Logging Validation Tests**:
- Verify logging configuration loads correctly and produces JSON output
- Test that service layer operations generate expected log entries with proper context
- Validate that API layer errors are logged with request details and error information
- Ensure logging doesn't break existing E2E tests (logs go to stderr, not stdout)

**Integration with Existing Tests**:
- Verify logging works with existing unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Test logging behavior during integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Confirm E2E tests in `tests/e2e/` continue to work with logging enabled
- Validate that structured logs provide useful debugging information for CI pipeline
