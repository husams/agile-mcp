# Story 1.3: Create and Retrieve Stories

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** AI Agent,
**I want** to create a new user story within a specific epic and retrieve its details,
**so that** I can define and access the requirements for a unit of work.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `backlog.createStory` tool is available and correctly associates the story with the specified epic.
2. The tool accepts a title, description, and a list of acceptance criteria.
3. A `backlog.getStory` tool is available and returns the full, self-contained details of a specified story.
4. The story is created with a default status of "ToDo".
5. All existing tests continue to pass and new tests for this story pass at 100%.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion: Epic entity model is implemented and functional. FastMCP server infrastructure is established, 3-layer architecture is in place, and Epic-Story relationship foundation is ready for Story implementation. Database setup foundations are ready for Story entity implementation.

### Tech Stack & Dependencies
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python ~3.11
- **MCP SDK**: FastMCP (Latest) - handles MCP communication, tool definition, and web server
- **Database**: SQLite ~3.37+ (local, file-based relational database)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy ~2.0 (database toolkit and ORM)
- **Testing**: Pytest ~8.2.2

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns]
- **3-Layer Architecture**: Must implement three distinct layers:
  1. **API/Tool Layer**: FastMCP tool implementations with @mcp.tool() decorators, parameter validation, exception translation to MCP errors
  2. **Service/Business Logic Layer**: Core story management logic, protocol-agnostic business rules
  3. **Data Access/Repository Layer**: Story database interactions using repository pattern
- **Repository Pattern**: StoryRepository class to abstract database operations from business logic
- **Monolithic Service**: Single deployable unit with all layers integrated

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Story Entity Requirements:**
- **id**: string - Unique identifier
- **title**: string - A short, descriptive title
- **description**: string - The full user story text
- **acceptanceCriteria**: string[] - A list of conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete
- **status**: string - Current state (ToDo, InProgress, Review, Done)
- **Relationships**: Belongs to one Epic (foreign key relationship)

### MCP Tool Implementation Pattern
[Source: architecture/mcp-server-implementation-examples.md]
Tools must follow FastMCP SDK patterns:
```python
@mcp.tool()
def create_story(epic_id: str, title: str, description: str, acceptance_criteria: list[str]) -> dict:
    """Tool implementation with type hints and docstring"""
    try:
        # Service layer call
        story = story_service.create_story(epic_id, title, description, acceptance_criteria)
        return story.to_dict()
    except CustomServiceException as e:
        # Translate to MCP error
        raise McpError(code=-32001, message=str(e))

@mcp.tool()
def get_story(story_id: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves the full details for a single story by its unique ID."""
    try:
        story = story_service.get_story(story_id)
        return story.to_dict()
    except StoryNotFoundError as e:
        raise McpError(code=-32001, message=str(e), data={"story_id": story_id})
```

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- **Service Layer**: Define custom exceptions for business logic failures (StoryNotFoundError, EpicNotFoundError, StoryValidationError, etc.)
- **API/Tool Layer**: Translate custom exceptions to standard MCP errors with code -32001 and appropriate messages
- **Repository Layer**: Handle SQLAlchemy exceptions and translate to service-level errors

### File Locations and Project Structure
Based on existing 1.2 implementation and 3-layer architecture:
- **API/Tool Layer**: `src/agile_mcp/api/` directory - Story tools registration and MCP error handling
- **Service Layer**: `src/agile_mcp/services/` directory - StoryService class with business logic
- **Repository Layer**: `src/agile_mcp/repositories/` directory - StoryRepository class with database operations
- **Models**: `src/agile_mcp/models/` directory - Story SQLAlchemy entity definition
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/` and `tests/e2e/` - Unit and end-to-end tests following testing strategy

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Testing Standards
- **Framework**: Pytest ~8.2.2
- **Test Location**: 
  - Unit tests: `tests/unit/`
  - Integration tests: `tests/integration/`
  - End-to-end tests: `tests/e2e/`

#### Testing Approach by Layer
- **Unit Tests**: Mock upper layers, test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test service-repository interactions with temporary SQLite database
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full stack testing with subprocess fixture using MCP JSON-RPC over stdio transport

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- All acceptance criteria scenarios must be covered at both unit and E2E levels
- Error handling scenarios with invalid parameters (AC validation)
- Complete request/response cycle validation from AI agent perspective

#### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
- Story model/entity definition and validation testing
- StoryRepository testing with in-memory SQLite database
- StoryService business logic testing with mocked repository
- API/Tool layer testing with mocked service layer
- Full MCP protocol testing for `backlog.createStory` and `backlog.getStory` tools
