# Story 6.6: Update getNextReadyStory Workflow

**Status:** ToDo

**Epic:** 6.0 Agent Workflow & Model Enhancements

**Story:**

**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** the `backlog.getNextReadyStory` tool to return the full, self-sufficient story object,
**so that** I can immediately begin work with all necessary context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The `backlog.getNextReadyStory` tool's return payload is updated to the new, rich `Story` model.
2. The tool's logic remains the same (respecting dependencies and status), but the data it returns is now comprehensive.
3. The performance of the tool is not significantly degraded by the larger payload.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**

- [ ] **Update getNextReadyStory Return Payload** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Verify tool returns all new Story model fields: tasks, structured_acceptance_criteria, comments, dev_notes
  - [ ] Ensure StoryResponse model includes all rich story data
  - [ ] Test JSON serialization of complete story object
  - [ ] Verify proper handling of null/empty structured fields
  - [ ] Update any response documentation or schemas

- [ ] **Maintain Existing Selection Logic** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Verify dependency checking logic remains unchanged
  - [ ] Ensure status filtering (Ready, In Progress) works correctly
  - [ ] Test priority-based story selection with rich data model
  - [ ] Confirm epic-based filtering continues to work
  - [ ] Validate story ordering and selection criteria

- [ ] **Performance Optimization for Rich Payload** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Measure payload size impact of rich story model
  - [ ] Optimize database queries to efficiently load all story data
  - [ ] Consider lazy loading strategies for optional fields
  - [ ] Test performance with stories containing large amounts of structured data
  - [ ] Benchmark against original payload size and response time

- [ ] **Comprehensive Story Data Validation**
  - [ ] Ensure all story fields are properly serialized in response
  - [ ] Test with stories that have partial structured data (some fields empty)
  - [ ] Verify backward compatibility with stories created before enhancements
  - [ ] Test edge cases: stories with maximum data in all fields
  - [ ] Validate proper timestamp formatting in comments

- [ ] **Database Query Optimization**
  - [ ] Review SQL queries generated for getNextReadyStory
  - [ ] Optimize joins and data loading for story dependencies
  - [ ] Consider database indexing strategies for improved performance
  - [ ] Test query performance with large datasets
  - [ ] Ensure minimal database round trips

- [ ] **Create Unit Tests for Enhanced getNextReadyStory**
  - [ ] Test return payload includes all story fields
  - [ ] Test performance with rich story data
  - [ ] Test selection logic with enhanced story model
  - [ ] Test serialization of complex structured fields
  - [ ] Test memory usage with large story payloads

- [ ] **Integration Tests for Developer Agent Workflow**
  - [ ] Test end-to-end: getNextReadyStory -> receive rich context -> begin development
  - [ ] Test with stories created via enhanced creation workflow (Story 6.5)
  - [ ] Verify Developer Agent can consume all provided context
  - [ ] Test workflow efficiency improvements
  - [ ] Test backward compatibility with existing developer workflows

**Dev Notes:**

**Context from PRD:**
This story completes the agent workflow enhancement by ensuring Developer Agents receive comprehensive, self-sufficient story objects that eliminate the need for additional context queries. This maximizes agent autonomy and workflow efficiency.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Focus on enhancing data richness without changing selection logic
- Optimize for performance to handle larger payloads efficiently
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing getNextReadyStory usage
- Measure and validate performance impact

**Dependencies:**
- **RECOMMENDED**: Stories 6.1-6.4 completed for full structured story support
- **RECOMMENDED**: Story 6.5 completed for stories with rich dev_notes context

**Performance Considerations:**
- Rich story objects will have larger JSON payloads
- Database queries may need optimization for complex story data
- Consider pagination or streaming for very large stories
- Monitor memory usage with enhanced story objects
- Benchmark against performance requirements

**Self-Sufficient Story Validation:**
- Story contains all tasks with clear descriptions
- Structured acceptance criteria provide detailed requirements
- Comments include relevant discussion context
- Dev_notes contain comprehensive technical guidance
- No additional queries needed for development work

**Workflow Impact:**
- Reduces Developer Agent query overhead
- Improves development startup time
- Provides richer context for better development decisions
- Maintains existing dependency and status management
