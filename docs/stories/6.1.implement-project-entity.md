# Story 6.1: Implement Project Entity

**Status:** Done

**Epic:** 6.0 Agent Workflow & Model Enhancements

**Story:**

**As a** System,
**I want** to introduce a top-level `Project` entity that contains all associated Epics, Stories, and Documents,
**so that** all project artifacts are organized under a single, queryable root.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A `Project` data model is created with attributes for `id`, `name`, and `description`.
2. Existing `Epic` models are updated to include a foreign key relationship to a `Project`.
3. A `projects.create` tool is created to initialize a new project.
4. A `projects.find` tool is created to list all existing projects.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**

- [x] **Create Project Data Model** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `Project` model in `src/agile_mcp/models/project.py`
  - [x] Add SQLAlchemy mapping with id (primary key), name, description fields
  - [x] Add validation for required fields (name cannot be empty)
  - [x] Add to_dict() method for JSON serialization
  - [x] Create ProjectResponse Pydantic model in response.py

- [x] **Update Epic Model with Project Relationship** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add `project_id` foreign key field to Epic model
  - [x] Add relationship property to access parent project
  - [x] Update Epic model validation to ensure project_id exists
  - [x] Create database migration to add project_id column to epics table
  - [x] Update EpicResponse model to include project information

- [x] **Create Project Management Tools** (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Create `projects.create` tool in new project_tools.py
  - [x] Create `projects.find` tool to list all projects
  - [x] Add proper validation and error handling
  - [x] Create ProjectService for business logic
  - [x] Create ProjectRepository for data access

- [x] **Create Unit Tests for Project Functionality**
  - [x] Test Project model validation and serialization
  - [x] Test Project-Epic relationship functionality
  - [x] Test project management tools
  - [x] Test database operations and migrations

- [x] **Integration Tests and Database Migration**
  - [x] Update database schema creation scripts
  - [x] Test project-epic relationship queries
  - [x] Verify backward compatibility for existing epics
  - [x] Test project listing and creation workflows

**Dev Notes:**

**Context from PRD:**
This story implements the foundational project-centric data model described in Epic 6 PRD. It establishes the hierarchical relationship: Project -> Epic -> Story, enabling better organization and context management for agent workflows.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Follow established patterns from Epic and Story models
- Use SQLAlchemy relationships for Project-Epic association
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing Epic data
- Create comprehensive validation and error handling

**Dependencies:**
- Core data model changes that affect Epic model
- Database migration strategy for existing data
- Foundation for Document model (next story)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-31
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation quality following established patterns and best practices. The Project entity implementation is comprehensive, well-structured, and follows the existing codebase architecture. All code is clean, properly documented, and includes robust validation and error handling.

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring was necessary - the implementation is already of high quality and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows established patterns from Epic/Story models
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper layered architecture (models, repositories, services, tools)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage (13 tests total)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist
All items completed successfully during development:

- [x] Project model with SQLAlchemy mapping and validation (models/project.py:1-72)
- [x] ProjectResponse Pydantic model for API responses (models/response.py:25-31)
- [x] Epic model updated with project_id foreign key relationship (models/epic.py:39,53)
- [x] Project service layer with business logic validation (services/project_service.py:1-105)
- [x] Project repository for data access operations (repositories/project_repository.py:1-83)
- [x] Project management tools (projects.create, projects.find) (api/project_tools.py:1-157)
- [x] Project exceptions added to services layer (services/exceptions.py)
- [x] Tools registered in main.py FastMCP server (main.py:32,62)
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for models, services, repositories, tools
- [x] Integration tests for Project-Epic relationship functionality
- [x] All tests passing (13/13 tests pass)

### Security Review
✓ No security concerns identified. Input validation is properly implemented at both model and service layers with appropriate length constraints and sanitization.

### Performance Considerations
✓ No performance issues identified. Database operations use proper indexing with primary keys and foreign key relationships. UUID generation for IDs is appropriate for distributed systems.

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

All acceptance criteria are fully met, implementation follows best practices, comprehensive test coverage exists, and all tests are passing. The Project entity successfully establishes the foundation for the hierarchical Project -> Epic -> Story data model as specified in the PRD.
