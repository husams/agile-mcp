# Story 5.2: Fix Artifact Tools E2E Tests

**Status:** Done

**Epic:** 5.0 E2E Test Failure Remediation

**Story:**

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to fix the failing E2E tests for the artifact management tools by resolving dependency and import issues,  
**so that** the MCP server starts successfully during E2E test execution and all 11 artifact tool tests pass with proper JSON responses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. MCP server starts successfully during E2E test execution without import/dependency errors
2. All required dependencies (especially `structlog`) are available in the test environment
3. All 11 E2E tests for artifact tools pass without import/startup errors
4. Artifact tools return properly serialized JSON responses using Pydantic models
5. Tests validate both success and error cases for `artifacts.linkToStory` and `artifacts.listForStory`
6. Relative import issues in `src/agile_mcp/main.py` are resolved
7. Artifact tool functions use ArtifactResponse model from Story 5.1

**Tasks / Subtasks:**

- [x] **Fix Server Startup Dependencies** (AC: 1, 2, 6)
  - [x] Add missing `structlog` dependency to requirements.txt or setup.py
  - [x] Resolve relative import issues in `src/agile_mcp/main.py`
  - [x] Ensure test environment has all required dependencies installed

- [x] **Integrate Pydantic Response Models** (AC: 4, 7)
  - [x] Import ArtifactResponse model from `src/agile_mcp/models/response.py`
  - [x] Refactor artifact tool functions to return ArtifactResponse instances
  - [x] Add proper JSON serialization using `.model_dump()` method
  - [x] Ensure artifact response fields match current dictionary structure
  - [x] Add error response handling with consistent JSON format

- [x] **Fix E2E Test Execution** (AC: 3, 5)
  - [x] Run all 11 E2E tests for artifact tools individually
  - [x] Fix any remaining test failures after dependency resolution
  - [x] Validate JSON response parsing in E2E tests
  - [x] Test both success scenarios (valid artifact linking) and error scenarios
  - [x] Verify `artifacts.linkToStory` and `artifacts.listForStory` tool functionality

- [x] **Validation and Testing** (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Execute `pytest tests/e2e/test_artifact_tools_e2e.py -v` successfully
  - [x] Validate all 11 tests pass (currently 9/11 failing)
  - [x] Test artifact linking workflow end-to-end
  - [x] Verify proper JSON-RPC response format compliance
  - [x] Document any remaining issues or dependencies

**Dev Notes:**

**Project Context:**
This story addresses E2E test failures for artifact management tools. The root cause analysis shows server startup failures due to missing `structlog` dependency and relative import issues, preventing tests from even reaching the response parsing stage.

**Dependencies:**
- **RECOMMENDED**: Story 5.1 completed for ArtifactResponse model integration
- Part of Epic 5.0 E2E Test Failure Remediation addressing 31 total failing E2E tests

**Tech Stack & Dependencies:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python ~3.11
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic (Latest) - Data validation and serialization for consistent JSON responses
- **MCP SDK**: FastMCP (Latest) - Handles MCP communication, tool definition, and web server
- **Database**: SQLite ~3.37+ - Local, file-based relational database
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy ~2.0 - Database toolkit and ORM for data access
- **Testing**: Pytest ~8.2.2 - Testing framework for unit and E2E tests
- **Logging**: Structlog (Required) - Missing dependency causing server startup failures

**Root Cause Analysis (from test failures):**
- E2E tests fail during server initialization phase due to missing `structlog` dependency
- Additional import errors suggest issues with module structure and relative imports in `main.py`
- All 11 E2E tests fail with identical server startup errors before reaching JSON response parsing
- Tests expect JSON responses but never reach the response parsing stage due to server startup failure

**Failing Test Pattern:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'structlog'
ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package
```

```

**Current ArtifactResponse Model (response.py:19-25):**
```python
class ArtifactResponse(BaseModel):
    id: str
    story_id: str
    uri: str
    relation_type: str
    created_at: Optional[str]
```

**Artifact Tool Functions to Fix:**
1. `artifacts.linkToStory` - Links artifacts to stories
2. `artifacts.listForStory` - Lists artifacts for a specific story
3. Related artifact management functions

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Fix dependencies** - Add structlog to requirements and resolve imports
2. **Test server startup** - Verify MCP server initializes correctly
3. **Integrate Pydantic models** - Use ArtifactResponse for consistent responses
4. **Run E2E tests** - Validate all 11 tests pass with proper JSON responses

**Testing:**

**Framework:** Pytest  
**Test Location:** `tests/e2e/test_artifact_tools_e2e.py`  
**Test Command:** `pytest tests/e2e/test_artifact_tools_e2e.py -v`  
**Success Criteria:** All 11 E2E tests pass with proper server startup and JSON responses

**Testing Standards:**
- E2E tests simulate MCP client interactions via stdio transport
- Tests validate JSON-RPC request/response format compliance
- Server must start successfully before any test execution
- All artifact tool responses must be valid JSON
- Support both success and error scenarios

**Expected Test Cases (11 total):**
- Artifact linking success scenarios
- Artifact listing for stories
- Error handling (invalid URIs, missing stories, etc.)
- Edge cases and validation scenarios

**Validation Steps:**
1. Fix server startup dependencies and imports
2. Integrate ArtifactResponse model in artifact tools
3. Run individual E2E tests to identify specific failures
4. Validate JSON response format compliance
5. Test complete artifact management workflow
