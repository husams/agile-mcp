# Story 7.1: Link New Documentation in README

**Status:** Done

**Epic:** 7.0 Project Documentation Enhancements

**Story:**

**As a** Developer,
**I want** the new documentation files (`configuration.md`, `coding_guidelines.md`, `technical_debt.md`) to be linked from the `README.md`,
**so that** they are easily discoverable from the project's entry point.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The `README.md` file is updated to include a new section or update an existing section with links to:
   - `docs/configuration.md`
   - `docs/coding_guidelines.md`
   - `docs/technical_debt.md`
2. The links are functional and point to the correct files.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**

- [x] **Update README.md Documentation Section** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add links to the three new documentation files in the existing Documentation section
  - [x] Ensure consistent formatting with existing documentation links
  - [x] Verify links use correct relative paths

- [x] **Verify Link Functionality** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Test that all new links navigate to correct files
  - [x] Confirm links work in both local file system and GitHub rendering
  - [x] Validate relative path structure

- [x] **Code Quality Validation - MANDATORY** ⚠️
  - [x] Verify no syntax errors in README.md markdown
  - [x] Check for consistent formatting and style
  - [x] Ensure proper markdown link syntax

**Dev Notes:**

**Project Context:**
This story enhances the discoverability of the three new documentation files (Configuration Management, Coding Guidelines, and Technical Debt Management) by linking them directly from the project's main entry point - the README.md file. This follows standard open-source project conventions where all essential documentation is accessible from the README.

**Dependencies:**
- **REQUIRED**: Configuration Management documentation (`docs/configuration.md`) - VERIFIED EXISTS
- **REQUIRED**: Coding Guidelines documentation (`docs/coding_guidelines.md`) - VERIFIED EXISTS
- **REQUIRED**: Technical Debt Management documentation (`docs/technical_debt.md`) - VERIFIED EXISTS
- Part of Epic 7.0 Project Documentation Enhancements

**Architecture Integration Context:**
[Source: architecture/index.md#additional-documentation]
The architecture documentation already includes links to all three files in the "Additional Documentation" section:
- Configuration Management (../configuration.md)
- Coding Guidelines and Conventions (../coding_guidelines.md)
- Technical Debt Management (../technical_debt.md)

**Current README.md Structure:**
[Source: Current README.md analysis]
The README.md file contains a Documentation section (lines 91-96) that currently includes:
- Product Requirements Document (docs/prd.md)
- Architecture Overview (docs/architecture.md)
- User Stories (docs/stories/)
- MCP Protocol Documentation (docs/mcp/)

**Implementation Approach:**
The new documentation files should be added to the existing Documentation section in README.md, maintaining consistent formatting with the current link structure. The links should follow the same pattern as existing documentation links using relative paths.

**Target Documentation Section Update:**
```markdown
## Documentation

- [Product Requirements Document](docs/prd.md)
- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)
- [Configuration Management](docs/configuration.md)
- [Coding Guidelines and Conventions](docs/coding_guidelines.md)
- [Technical Debt Management](docs/technical_debt.md)
- [User Stories](docs/stories/)
- [MCP Protocol Documentation](docs/mcp/)
```

**Relevant Source Tree:**
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
```
agile-mcp/
├── docs/                           # Documentation and specifications
│   ├── configuration.md            # NEW: Configuration management documentation
│   ├── coding_guidelines.md        # NEW: Coding guidelines and conventions
│   ├── technical_debt.md           # NEW: Technical debt management

└── README.md                      # Main project entry point - NEEDS UPDATE
```

**File Modification Required:**
- **Target File**: `README.md` (project root)
- **Modification Type**: Content addition to existing Documentation section
- **Change Location**: Lines 91-96 (Documentation section)

**Testing:**

**Framework:** Manual verification (Markdown documentation)

**Test Approach:**
- Verify markdown syntax correctness
- Test link functionality in both local file system and GitHub
- Confirm consistent formatting with existing documentation links

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Documentation changes require manual verification of link functionality
- Markdown syntax validation through standard markdown parsers
- Visual validation in both local file system and GitHub rendering

**Success Criteria:**
- README.md Documentation section includes links to all three new documentation files
- All links are functional and navigate to correct files
- Link formatting is consistent with existing documentation structure
- No markdown syntax errors introduced
