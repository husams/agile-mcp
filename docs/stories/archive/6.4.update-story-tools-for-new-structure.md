**Dev Notes:**

**Project Context:**
This story ensures that the existing story management tools (`backlog.createStory`, `backlog.updateStory`, `backlog.getStory`) work seamlessly with the new structured story data model introduced in Stories 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 (tasks, structured acceptance criteria, and comments). This maintains API consistency while leveraging the enhanced story structure.

**Dependencies:**
- **REQUIRED**: Stories 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 completed (tasks, structured acceptance criteria, and comments functionality)
- Part of Epic 6.0 Advanced Story Structure & BMAD Method Alignment

**Previous Story Insights (from Stories 6.1, 6.2 & 6.3):**
- Story model successfully extended with tasks, structured_acceptance_criteria, and comments as JSON fields with comprehensive validation
- Management tool patterns established for adding, updating, and managing structured data elements
- JSON field validation and serialization patterns proven for backward compatibility
- StoryResponse model extension pattern successful for including structured fields in API responses
- Database migration patterns established for adding JSON columns with default values

**Tech Stack & Dependencies:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python ~3.11
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic (Latest) - Data validation and serialization for consistent JSON responses
- **MCP SDK**: FastMCP (Latest) - Handles MCP communication, tool definition, and web server
- **Database**: SQLite ~3.37+ - Local, file-based relational database
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy ~2.0 - Database toolkit and ORM for data access
- **Testing**: Pytest ~8.2.2 - Testing framework for unit and E2E tests

**Data Models:**
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Story]
- **Story Entity**: Now contains tasks, structured_acceptance_criteria, and comments as JSON fields
- **Structured Field Formats**: Established JSON schemas for tasks (task objects with description/completed), structured acceptance criteria (AC objects with description/status), and comments (comment objects with id/author_role/content/timestamp/reply_to_id)

**Current Story Tool Structure (from Stories 6.1-6.3 implementations):**
```python
# Story Model Fields (current state):
{
    'id': str,
    'epic_id': str,
    'title': str,
    'description': str,
    'status': str,
    'dev_notes': str,
    'tasks': list[dict],                        # Added in Story 6.1
    'structured_acceptance_criteria': list[dict], # Added in Story 6.2
    'comments': list[dict]                      # Added in Story 6.3
}
```

**Target API Tool Updates:**
1. **`backlog.createStory`**: Accept optional structured field parameters during story creation
2. **`backlog.updateStory`**: Support updating individual structured fields while maintaining validation
3. **`backlog.getStory`**: Already working but needs verification of proper structured data serialization

**MCP Tool Patterns (following established patterns):**
[Source: architecture/mcp-server-implementation-examples.md]
- Tool naming: `backlog.{action}` for main story management operations
- Validation: Use established Pydantic models and service layer validation
- Response: Use StoryResponse model for consistent API responses
- Error handling: Translate service exceptions to appropriate MCP errors

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Update backlog.createStory** - Add optional structured field parameters with validation
2. **Update backlog.updateStory** - Support structured field updates with existing field validation patterns
3. **Verify backlog.getStory** - Ensure proper serialization of all structured data
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** - All existing functionality must continue working
5. **Comprehensive testing** - Unit and integration tests for all tool update scenarios

**Testing:**

**Framework:** Pytest
**Test Locations:**
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/unit/test_backlog_tools.py`, `tests/unit/test_story_service.py`
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/test_story_flow.py`
- **E2E Tests**: `tests/e2e/test_story_tools_e2e.py`

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on tool parameter validation and service method behavior in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between API tools and service/repository layers for structured field operations
- **E2E Tests**: Validate MCP protocol compliance for updated tools via stdio transport
- **Database Testing**: Use temporary SQLite database with transaction rollback for clean state
- **Test Isolation**: Each test runs independently with proper setup/teardown

**Success Criteria:**
- All existing story management tools work seamlessly with structured story data
- Story creation and updates support the new structured fields with proper validation
- Story retrieval correctly serializes and returns all structured data elements
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing stories and tool usage patterns
- All existing story-related functionality continues to work without disruption
