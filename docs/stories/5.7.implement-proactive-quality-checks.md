**Pre-commit Hook Strategy (from test-failure-recommendations.md:349-350):**

**Hook Categories:**
1. **Format Validation** - JSON response format checking
2. **Protocol Compliance** - MCP protocol validation
3. **Schema Validation** - Pydantic model consistency
4. **Test Execution** - Critical E2E test subset
5. **Code Quality** - Linting, typing, security

**Pre-commit Configuration Example:**
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: json-response-validation
        name: Validate Tool Response Formats
        entry: scripts/validate_responses.py
        language: python
        files: ^src/agile_mcp/api/.*\.py$

      - id: critical-e2e-tests
        name: Run Critical E2E Tests (Production Server)
        entry: scripts/run_critical_tests.py --production-server
        language: python
        files: ^src/agile_mcp/(api|models|services)/.*\.py$

**Custom Response Validator Implementation:**
```python
# scripts/validate_responses.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Pre-commit hook to validate MCP tool response formats"""

import ast
import json
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List

def validate_tool_functions(file_path: Path) -> List[str]:
    """Validate all tool functions return JSON strings"""
    errors = []

    with open(file_path) as f:
        tree = ast.parse(f.read())

    for node in ast.walk(tree):
        if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef) and has_tool_decorator(node):
            # Validate function returns JSON string
            if not validates_json_return(node):
                errors.append(f"{file_path}:{node.lineno} - "
                            f"Tool function '{node.name}' must return JSON string")

    return errors
```

**Implementation Approach:**

**Phase 1: Basic Pre-commit Setup**
- Install pre-commit framework
- Configure basic code quality hooks (linting, formatting)
- Set up developer workflow documentation

**Phase 2: Response Format Validation**
- Implement custom JSON response validation hooks
- Integrate with existing test validation helpers
- Add MCP protocol compliance checking

**Phase 3: Automated Testing Integration**
- Add selective E2E test execution based on file changes (production server only)
- Implement fast feedback for critical test failures using production data
- Configure test result reporting from production server tests

**Phase 4: CI/CD Integration**
- Enforce pre-commit checks in GitHub Actions
- Add quality gates for PR approval
- Implement quality metrics and reporting

**Testing:**

**Framework:** Pre-commit hooks with custom validators
**Scope:** All MCP tool functions and response formats
**Success Criteria:** Quality checks prevent JSON format issues from reaching production

**Testing Standards:**
- Pre-commit hooks execute in <30 seconds for fast feedback using production server
- Custom validators integrate with existing test infrastructure (production server)
- Quality checks provide clear error messages for developers
- Emergency bypass procedures available for critical fixes
- Full quality check suite runs on CI/CD pipeline against production server
- All E2E validation uses production server with real data per architectural requirements

**Quality Check Categories:**
1. **Response Format** - JSON parsing and structure validation (production data)
2. **Protocol Compliance** - MCP JSON-RPC format validation (production server)
3. **Schema Validation** - Pydantic model consistency with real data
4. **Test Coverage** - Critical E2E test execution (production server only)
5. **Code Quality** - Linting, typing, security scanning

**Expected Benefits:**
- Prevention of JSON response format regressions using production data validation
- Early detection of E2E test failures during development with production server
- Consistent code quality across the team with production-first testing
- Reduced debugging time for response format issues through real data testing
- Improved developer confidence in API changes validated against production environment
