# Story 6.3: Add Story Comments

**Status:** Done

**Epic:** 6.0 Advanced Story Structure

**Story:**

**As an** AI Agent,
**I want** to add comments to a user story,
**so that** I can provide additional context, ask questions, or record discussions related to the story.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The Story data model is extended to include a list of comments.

**Dev Notes:**

**Project Context:**
This story extends the Story data model to support comments as structured data, enabling AI agents and human reviewers to add contextual information, ask questions, or record discussions related to a story. This aligns with the BMAD method for enhanced story collaboration and context management.

**Dependencies:**
- **RECOMMENDED**: Stories 6.1 and 6.2 completed for task management and structured acceptance criteria pattern reference
- Part of Epic 6.0 Advanced Story Structure & BMAD Method Alignment

**Previous Story Insights (from Stories 6.1 & 6.2):**
- Tasks and structured acceptance criteria fields successfully implemented as JSON columns with validation structure
- Management tools pattern established: add, update status, update description, reorder operations
- Database migration pattern established for adding JSON columns to stories table
- StoryResponse model extension pattern proven for backward compatibility

**Tech Stack & Dependencies:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python ~3.11
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic (Latest) - Data validation and serialization for consistent JSON responses
- **MCP SDK**: FastMCP (Latest) - Handles MCP communication, tool definition, and web server
- **Database**: SQLite ~3.37+ - Local, file-based relational database
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy ~2.0 - Database toolkit and ORM for data access
- **Testing**: Pytest ~8.2.2 - Testing framework for unit and E2E tests

**Data Models:**
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Story]
- **Story Entity**: Currently contains tasks and structured_acceptance_criteria as JSON fields - needs extension for comments
- **Comment Structure**: From ERD - contains id, story_id, author_role, content, timestamp, reply_to_id (optional)

**Target Comment Structure (following established JSON field pattern):**
```python
# Each comment structure:
{
    'id': str,           # Unique identifier within story
    'author_role': str,  # Role of commenter (e.g., 'Developer Agent', 'QA Agent', 'Human Reviewer')
    'content': str,      # The comment text content
    'timestamp': datetime, # When comment was created (ISO format for JSON serialization)
    'reply_to_id': str | None  # Optional - ID of comment this is replying to for threading
}
```

├── models/
│   ├── story.py                     # Story entity model - needs comments field extension
│   └── response.py                  # StoryResponse model - needs comments field addition

└── services/
    └── story_service.py             # Story business logic - may need comment validation
```

**API Tool Pattern (following established patterns from Stories 6.1 & 6.2):**
- Tool naming: `comments.{action}` following established pattern
- Primary operation: `addToStory` for adding comments
- Validation: story exists, author_role validation, proper structure format
- Response: Use appropriate Pydantic response models
- Timestamp handling: Automatic timestamp generation for new comments

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Extend Story model** - Add comments field following tasks/acceptance criteria JSON pattern
2. **Create comment management tools** - Following task/AC management tool patterns from Stories 6.1/6.2
3. **Update StoryResponse** - Include comments in API responses with proper timestamp serialization
4. **Backward compatibility** - Ensure existing functionality continues to work
5. **Migration strategy** - Handle existing stories without comments field

**Testing:**

**Framework:** Pytest
**Test Locations:**
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/unit/test_story_model.py`, `tests/unit/test_story_tools.py`
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/test_story_flow.py`
- **E2E Tests**: `tests/e2e/test_story_tools_e2e.py`

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on Story model validation and comment management functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between Service Layer and Repository Layer for comment operations
- **E2E Tests**: Validate MCP protocol compliance for comment management tools via stdio transport
- **Database Testing**: Use temporary SQLite database with transaction rollback for clean state
- **Test Isolation**: Each test runs independently with proper setup/teardown

**Success Criteria:**
- Story model supports comments with proper validation including timestamp and threading
- Comment management tools provide CRUD operations following established patterns
- StoryResponse includes comments field with proper timestamp serialization
- All existing tests pass with new comments field included
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing stories
