# Story 6.5: Update Story Creation Workflow

**Status:** Blocked

**Blocking Issue:** Core dependency `documents.getSection` tool not implemented. Requires Story 6.2 (Structured Document Storage) completion first.

**Epic:** 6.0 Agent Workflow & Model Enhancements

**Story:**

**As a** Scrum Master Agent,
**I want** to use the `documents.getSection` tool to gather context and compile it into the `dev_notes` of a new story,
**so that** I can create a self-sufficient, ready-to-code story for the Developer Agent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The `backlog.createStory` tool is updated to accept the new `dev_notes`, `tasks`, and other fields.
2. The tool correctly persists this new structured data when creating a story.
3. The workflow for the Scrum Master agent is documented, detailing the process of fetching sections and creating the story.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**

- [x] **Update backlog.createStory Tool for Rich Story Model** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add `dev_notes` parameter to createStory tool (structured text field)
  - [x] Ensure `tasks`, `structured_acceptance_criteria`, `comments` parameters are properly supported

  - [x] Test story creation with context from multiple document sections
  - [x] Verify self-sufficient stories contain adequate development context
  - [x] Test backward compatibility with existing story creation process

**Dev Notes:**

**Context from PRD:**
This story completes the agent workflow model by enabling the Scrum Master agent to create self-sufficient stories that contain all necessary context for immediate development. This reduces the need for Developer Agents to make additional queries for context.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extend existing backlog.createStory tool rather than creating new one
- Ensure dev_notes field supports rich, structured content
- Design workflow to be compatible with existing story creation patterns
- Focus on agent autonomy and efficiency improvements

**Dependencies:**
- **REQUIRED**: Story 6.2 (Structured Document Storage) - Need documents.getSection tool
- **RECOMMENDED**: Stories 6.1, 6.3-6.4 completed for full story structure support

**Workflow Design:**
1. Scrum Master identifies requirements for new story
2. Uses documents.getSection to gather relevant technical context
3. Compiles context into structured dev_notes
4. Creates story with rich context using enhanced createStory tool
5. Developer Agent receives self-sufficient story ready for implementation

**Self-Sufficient Story Criteria:**
- Contains all architectural context needed for implementation
- Includes relevant technical specifications and constraints
- Provides clear development guidance without additional queries
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing story format

- **API Layer**: `src/agile_mcp/api/story_tools.py:44-105` - Clean, well-documented interface with proper parameter validation
- **Service Layer**: `src/agile_mcp/services/story_service.py` - Robust validation logic with appropriate error handling
- **Data Model**: `src/agile_mcp/models/story.py:64` - Proper database constraints and field definitions
- **Utilities**: Both `context_compiler.py` and `document_integration.py` demonstrate excellent design patterns

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: ‚úì Full compliance with Black formatting and naming conventions
- **Project Structure**: ‚úì Files placed in appropriate locations following established patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: ‚úì Comprehensive test suite with 13 tests covering all scenarios
- **All ACs Met**: ‚úì Every acceptance criterion fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist
**All items completed by developer - no outstanding work:**

- [x] Rich dev_notes field implementation with 10K character validation
- [x] Context compilation utilities with multiple template support
- [x] Document integration for seamless context gathering
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (13 tests, 100% pass rate)
- [x] Proper error handling and validation throughout
- [x] Full backward compatibility maintained
- [x] API documentation and inline comments appropriate
- [x] Database constraints and model validation implemented

### Security Review
**No security concerns** - Implementation properly validates all inputs, uses parameterized queries through SQLAlchemy ORM, and includes appropriate length limits on text fields to prevent potential DoS attacks.

### Performance Considerations
**Well optimized** - Implementation uses efficient database operations, proper indexing on foreign keys, and reasonable validation logic. The 10K character limit on dev_notes prevents excessive memory usage while providing adequate space for technical context.

### Final Status
**‚ùå BLOCKED - Dependency Missing**

**Correction**: While the implementation quality is excellent, this story cannot be marked as Done due to missing core dependency. The `documents.getSection` tool required for the workflow is not implemented. Story 6.2 (Structured Document Storage) must be completed first.

**Implementation Achievement**: The story creation workflow enhancements are well-implemented, but the end-to-end workflow cannot function without the document system foundation.
