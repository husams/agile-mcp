# Story 6.2: Structured Acceptance Criteria

**Status:** Done

**Epic:** 6.0 Advanced Story Structure

**Story:**

**As a** Product Owner Agent,
**I want** to define acceptance criteria as structured, individual items within a story,
**so that** each criterion can be independently verified and tracked.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The Story data model is extended to include a structured list of acceptance criteria.
2. Tools are available to add, update, and mark acceptance criteria as met.
3. `backlog.getStory` returns the structured acceptance criteria.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**

- [x] **Extend Story Data Model with Structured Acceptance Criteria Field** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Modify Story model to support structured acceptance criteria with fields: `{'id': str, 'description': str, 'met': bool, 'order': int}`
  - [x] Update Story model validation to ensure structured acceptance criteria format
  - [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing string-based acceptance criteria
  - [x] Update Story.to_dict() method to include structured acceptance criteria field
  - [x] Create database migration for acceptance criteria structure change

- [x] **Implement Acceptance Criteria Management Tools** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create `acceptanceCriteria.addToStory` tool to add new criteria to a story
  - [x] Create `acceptanceCriteria.updateStatus` tool to mark criteria as met/unmet
  - [x] Create `acceptanceCriteria.updateDescription` tool to modify criteria descriptions
  - [x] Create `acceptanceCriteria.reorderCriteria` tool to change criteria order within a story
  - [x] Add proper validation for acceptance criteria operations (story exists, criteria exists, etc.)

- [x] **Update Story Retrieval to Include Structured Acceptance Criteria** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Modify `backlog.getStory` tool to return structured acceptance criteria field in response
  - [x] Update StoryResponse Pydantic model to include structured acceptance criteria field
  - [x] Ensure structured acceptance criteria are properly serialized in API responses
  - [x] Update story repository methods to handle structured acceptance criteria field

- [x] **Create Unit Tests for Acceptance Criteria Functionality**
  - [x] Test Story model with structured acceptance criteria field validation
  - [x] Test acceptance criteria management tools with various scenarios
  - [x] Test edge cases: empty criteria, invalid criteria structure, etc.
  - [x] Test database operations with structured acceptance criteria field

- [x] **Integration Tests Verified**
  - [x] Existing integration tests pass with structured acceptance criteria field included
  - [x] Story retrieval integration maintains backward compatibility
  - [x] Database persistence verified through existing test infrastructure

- [x] **Code Quality Validation - MANDATORY** ⚠️
  - [x] Run `ruff check .` - All linting checks **MUST** pass
  - [x] Run `mypy .` - All type checking **MUST** pass
  - [x] Fix any linting or type errors before story completion
  - [x] Verify no new warnings or errors introduced

**Dev Notes:**

**Project Context:**
This story extends the Story data model to support structured acceptance criteria as individual, trackable items rather than simple strings. This aligns with the BMAD method for more granular story management, allowing each acceptance criterion to be independently verified and tracked.

**Dependencies:**
- **RECOMMENDED**: Story 6.1 completed for task management pattern reference
- Part of Epic 6.0 Advanced Story Structure & BMAD Method Alignment

**Previous Story Insights (from Story 6.1):**
- Tasks field successfully implemented as JSON column with validation structure: `{'id': str, 'description': str, 'completed': bool, 'order': int}`
- Task management tools pattern established: add, update status, update description, reorder
- Database migration pattern established for adding JSON columns to stories table
- StoryResponse model extension pattern proven for backward compatibility

**Tech Stack & Dependencies:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python ~3.11
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic (Latest) - Data validation and serialization for consistent JSON responses
- **MCP SDK**: FastMCP (Latest) - Handles MCP communication, tool definition, and web server
- **Database**: SQLite ~3.37+ - Local, file-based relational database
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy ~2.0 - Database toolkit and ORM for data access
- **Testing**: Pytest ~8.2.2 - Testing framework for unit and E2E tests

**Data Models:**
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Story]
- **Story Entity**: Contains acceptance_criteria as list[string] - needs extension to structured format
- **Current Structure**: `acceptance_criteria`: list[string] - A list of precise, testable conditions
- **Target Structure**: Structured format allowing individual tracking and status management

**Current Story Model Structure (models/story.py:48):**
```python
acceptance_criteria: Mapped[List[str]] = mapped_column(JSON, nullable=False)
```

**Target Structured Acceptance Criteria Format:**
```python
# Each criterion structure:
{
    'id': str,           # Unique identifier within story
    'description': str,  # The acceptance criterion text
    'met': bool,        # Whether criterion has been satisfied
    'order': int        # Display/processing order
}
```

src/agile_mcp/
├── models/
│   ├── story.py                     # Story entity model - needs AC field extension
│   └── response.py                  # StoryResponse model - needs AC field addition
├── api/
│   └── story_tools.py               # Story management tools - needs AC tools
├── repositories/

└── services/
    └── story_service.py             # Story business logic - may need AC validation
```

**API Tool Pattern (from Story 6.1):**
- Tool naming: `acceptanceCriteria.{action}` following established pattern
- Operations: add, update status, update description, reorder
- Validation: story exists, criterion exists, proper structure format
- Response: Use appropriate Pydantic response models

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Extend Story model** - Add structured acceptance criteria field following tasks pattern
2. **Create AC management tools** - Following task management tool patterns from Story 6.1
3. **Update StoryResponse** - Include structured acceptance criteria in API responses
4. **Backward compatibility** - Ensure existing string-based AC continues to work
5. **Migration strategy** - Convert existing string AC to structured format

**Testing:**

**Framework:** Pytest
**Test Locations:**
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/unit/test_story_model.py`, `tests/unit/test_story_tools.py`
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/test_story_flow.py`
- **E2E Tests**: `tests/e2e/test_story_tools_e2e.py`

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on Story model validation and AC management functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between Service Layer and Repository Layer for AC operations
- **E2E Tests**: Validate MCP protocol compliance for AC management tools via stdio transport
- **Database Testing**: Use temporary SQLite database with transaction rollback for clean state
- **Test Isolation**: Each test runs independently with proper setup/teardown

**Success Criteria:**
- Story model supports structured acceptance criteria with proper validation
- AC management tools provide full CRUD operations following established patterns
- StoryResponse includes structured AC field with proper serialization
- All existing tests pass with new structured AC field included
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing string-based acceptance criteria
