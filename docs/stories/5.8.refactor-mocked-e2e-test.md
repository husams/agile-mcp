# Story 5.8: Refactor Mocked E2E Test to Use Real Server and Database

**Status:** Done

**Epic:** 5.0 E2E Test Failure Remediation

**Story:**

**As a** developer,
**I want** to refactor the `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py` test suite to interact with a real MCP server and production database via JSON-RPC,
**so that** our E2E tests fully comply with the "Into Wind Testing Guideline" by validating against the actual production environment with real data, ensuring maximum fidelity and preventing regressions related to server-side logic and database interactions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  The `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py` test file is modified to remove direct mocking of the MCP server and database.
2.  The test suite utilizes the `mcp_server_process` fixture (or an equivalent mechanism) to start the `run_server.py` as a subprocess.
3.  All interactions with the MCP server within `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py` are performed via JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout, mirroring real client-server communication.
4.  The test suite connects to the production database through the real server process, validating against actual production data as mandated by the E2E Testing Architecture.
5.  All existing test cases within `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py` pass successfully after refactoring.
6.  The refactored test adheres to the "Into Wind Testing Guideline" by testing against a running server and database, not mocked components.
7.  The test suite leverages the validation helpers from `tests/e2e/test_helpers.py` for JSON-RPC response validation.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**

- [x] **Analyze `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py`** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Identify all instances of `unittest.mock.Mock` related to the MCP server and database.
  - [x] Understand the current test flow and how mocked components are used.

- [x] **Integrate Real Server Process** (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Replace `mock_mcp_server` fixture with `mcp_server_process` fixture (or create a similar fixture if `mcp_server_process` is not directly reusable due to scope/setup differences).
  - [x] Adapt test functions to send JSON-RPC requests to the `mcp_server_process` stdin and read responses from stdout.
  - [x] Ensure proper server initialization and shutdown within the test setup/teardown.

- [x] **Configure Production Database Connection** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Configure the `mcp_server_process` to connect to the production database as required by architecture.
  - [x] Adapt test assertions to work with real production data variations and existing data state.

- [x] **Refactor Test Cases** (AC: 5, 7)
  - [x] Update existing test cases to use the real server interaction pattern (JSON-RPC calls).
  - [x] Integrate `validate_json_response`, `validate_jsonrpc_response_format`, and `validate_story_tool_response` (or other relevant helpers) from `tests/e2e/test_helpers.py` for robust response validation.
  - [x] Adjust assertions to reflect responses from a real server.

- [x] **Validate Compliance and Pass Rate** (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Run `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py` to ensure all tests pass.
  - [x] Confirm that the refactored test now truly operates against a real server and database, fulfilling the "Into Wind Testing Guideline".

**Dev Notes:**

**Project Context:**
The `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py` test suite currently uses `unittest.mock.Mock` to simulate the MCP server and its database interactions. This deviates from the architectural mandate for E2E tests, which requires them to run against a real server and database to ensure high fidelity and compliance with the "Into Wind Testing Guideline". This story aims to bring this specific test suite into full compliance, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of our E2E test coverage.

**Dependencies:**
- **CRITICAL**: Relies on the `mcp_server_process` fixture defined in `tests/e2e/conftest.py` configured for production database access.
- **INTEGRATES**: Leverages the enhanced test validation helpers implemented in Story 5.6 (`tests/e2e/test_helpers.py`).
- **ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE**: Must strictly adhere to the E2E Testing Requirements outlined in `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` and `docs/sprint_change_proposals/sprint-change-proposal-mcp-example-fix.md`.
- Part of Epic 5.0 E2E Test Failure Remediation.

**E2E Testing Architecture Compliance:**
- **MANDATORY**: All E2E tests MUST use the release server with real production data (per docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:13-46).
- **PROHIBITED**: No mocked data, isolated databases, or fabricated test data within E2E tests.
- **REQUIRED**: Interactions must occur via the defined MCP JSON-RPC protocol against production environment.
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Tests must validate against actual production data structures and content.

**Tech Stack & Dependencies:**
- **Language**: Python ~3.11
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest ~8.2.2
- **Server Communication**: JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout (via `subprocess` module)
- **Database**: Production SQLite database (real data, managed by the server process)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy ~2.0 (used by the server)
- **Validation**: Pydantic (for response models, used by `test_helpers.py`)

**Current E2E Test Structure (relevant file):**
```
tests/e2e/
├── conftest.py                      # Defines mcp_server_process and isolated_test_database
├── test_helpers.py                  # Validation utilities
└── test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py # Target file for refactoring (currently uses mocks)
```

**Implementation Approach:**

1.  **Replace Mocking:** Remove `mock_mcp_server` and `override_get_db` usage from `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py`.
2.  **Configure Production Server:** Integrate the `mcp_server_process` fixture configured to connect to production database. This fixture handles starting and stopping the `run_server.py` subprocess with production database connection.
3.  **JSON-RPC Communication:** Convert existing test logic that directly calls mocked functions into `send_jsonrpc_request` calls, similar to how other E2E tests communicate with the server.
4.  **Production Data Validation:** Utilize the `validate_story_tool_response` and other helpers from `test_helpers.py` to robustly validate JSON-RPC responses while accounting for real production data variations.
5.  **Production Test Verification:** Adapt test assertions to work with existing production data state and run the refactored test suite to ensure functionality against real production environment.

**Testing:**

**Framework:** Pytest
**Scope:** `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py`
**Success Criteria:** All tests within `test_get_next_ready_story_e2e.py` pass after refactoring, and the test no longer uses direct mocking of the server or database.

**Testing Standards:**
- The refactored test must pass all existing assertions.
- The test must demonstrate interaction with the server via JSON-RPC.
- Tests must operate on shared production data state as mandated by E2E Testing Architecture.
- Test assertions must account for real production data variations and existing data conditions.

**Security Considerations:**

**Production Data Access:**
- E2E tests will interact with production database containing real project data
- JSON-RPC communication over stdin/stdout provides process-level isolation
- No network-based authentication required for subprocess communication
- Production data modifications are limited to test-specific operations

**Data Integrity:**
- Tests must not corrupt or delete existing production data
- Status updates to stories should be validated for test-specific IDs only
- Consider read-only operations where possible to minimize production impact

**Access Control:**
- Server process runs with same permissions as test execution environment
- No additional privilege escalation through MCP JSON-RPC protocol
- Database access controlled through existing SQLAlchemy ORM constraints

**Test Data Management Strategy:**

**Production Data Handling:**
- Tests must work with existing production data state without assumptions about data cleanliness
- Test assertions should be resilient to production data variations (different story counts, priorities, statuses)
- Use data queries to understand current state before making assertions (e.g., count existing ToDo stories)

**Data State Management:**
- Tests should create test-specific data with recognizable IDs (e.g., prefixed with "e2e-test-")
- Avoid depending on specific story IDs or counts that may vary in production
- Use relative assertions (e.g., "returned story has highest priority among ToDo stories") rather than absolute values

**Data Cleanup Strategy:**
- Test data should be cleaned up after test completion to avoid production pollution
- Critical: Mark any created test stories as "Done" or delete them entirely after test runs
- Consider using database transactions that can be rolled back, if supported by test framework

**Expected Benefits:**
- Increased confidence in the `backlog.getNextReadyStory` tool's functionality in actual production environment.
- Full compliance with the "Into Wind Testing Guideline" for E2E tests.
- Reduced risk of regressions that might be missed by mocked tests.
- Improved consistency across the E2E test suite.
- Maximum test fidelity through real production data validation.
