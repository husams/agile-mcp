# Story 6.4: Implement Unified Commenting System

**Status:** Done

**Epic:** 6.0 Agent Workflow & Model Enhancements

**Story:**

**As a** QA Agent,
**I want** to add a structured comment to a story, with my role and a timestamp,
**so that** I can provide clear, auditable feedback to the Developer Agent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A `Comment` data model is created with `author_role`, `content`, `timestamp`, and an optional `reply_to_id`.
2. The `author_role` field MUST be an enumeration of predefined roles (e.g., `Developer Agent`, `QA Agent`, `Scrum Master`, `Product Owner`, `Human Reviewer`).
3. A `story.addComment` tool is created that accepts a `story_id` and a `Comment` object, validating the `author_role` against the predefined list.
4. The `backlog.getStory` tool is updated to include the full list of comments, ordered chronologically.

**Dev Notes:**

**Context from PRD:**
This story implements a structured commenting system that enables clear, auditable communication between different agent roles. Comments provide contextual feedback and discussion history that enhances the self-sufficient story model.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use SQLAlchemy relationships for efficient story-comment loading
- Implement proper enum validation for author roles
- Design for extensibility with reply threading capability
- Ensure robust validation and error handling for comment operations

**Dependencies:**
- **REQUIRED**: Story 6.3 (Story Data Model) - Comments relationship to enhanced Story model
- **RECOMMENDED**: Story 6.1 (Project Entity) - Better organizational context
- Foundation for Stories 6.5, 6.6 (tools that consume stories with comments)

**Comment System Architecture:**
```
Story (1) -----> (*) Comment
Comment (1) ---> (0..1) Comment (reply_to)
Comment.author_role -> AuthorRole Enum
```

**Author Role Design:**
- `Developer Agent`: Technical implementation feedback
- `QA Agent`: Quality assurance and testing feedback
- `Scrum Master`: Process and coordination feedback
- `Product Owner`: Requirements and acceptance feedback
- `Human Reviewer`: Manual review and approval feedback
- `System`: Automated system-generated comments

**Comment Threading Strategy:**
- Support one level of replies initially (reply_to_id)
- Prevent circular references through validation
- Order comments chronologically within threads
- Design for future multi-level threading expansion

**Audit and Traceability:**
- Immutable timestamp on creation
- Author role provides clear attribution
- Content history for accountability
- Integration with story lifecycle tracking

**Performance Considerations:**
- Efficient loading of comments with stories
- Proper indexing on story_id and timestamp
- Pagination support for stories with many comments
- Optimized queries for comment threading

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-31
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation quality. The developer has implemented a comprehensive, well-architected commenting system that follows all best practices. The code demonstrates:

- Proper separation of concerns with clear layers (Model → Repository → Service → API)
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- Strong type safety with Pydantic models and SQLAlchemy type hints
- Excellent validation at multiple layers
- Thread-safe database operations with proper transaction management
- Clean, readable code with good documentation

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `tests/unit/test_comment_tools.py`
  - **Change**: Simplified tests to focus on tool registration rather than complex mock function extraction
