# Story 1.1: Service Initialization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Host Application,
**I want** to initialize a stateful session with the Agile Management Service using MCP,
**so that** I can enable an AI agent to interact with it.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The service correctly handles an `initialize` request from an MCP client.
2. The service responds with its capabilities, declaring support for `tools`.
3. A successful session is established and maintained.
4. The service adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification for all communications.
5. The service handles initialization errors gracefully (invalid protocol version, malformed requests).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in the project.

### Tech Stack & Dependencies
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python ~3.11
- **MCP SDK**: FastMCP (Latest) - handles MCP communication, tool definition, and web server
- **Database**: SQLite ~3.37+ (for future stories, basic setup needed)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy ~2.0 (for future database operations)
- **Testing**: Pytest ~8.2.2

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns]
- **3-Layer Architecture**: Must implement three distinct layers:
  1. **API/Tool Layer**: FastMCP SDK implementation, validates parameters, translates exceptions to MCP errors
  2. **Service/Business Logic Layer**: Core application logic, protocol-agnostic
  3. **Data Access/Repository Layer**: Database interactions (minimal for this story)
- **Monolithic Service**: Single deployable unit running locally
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction (foundation setup needed)

### MCP Server Implementation Details
[Source: architecture/mcp-server-implementation-examples.md]
- FastMCP SDK will be used to define MCP primitives (Tools, Resources, Prompts)
- JSON-RPC communication handled automatically by FastMCP
- Server must respond to initialization requests with capabilities

### Project Structure
[Source: 3-layer architecture pattern from architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
Established directory structure following 3-layer architecture:
- **Root Level**: `main.py` or `server.py` - Main server entry point
- **API/Tool Layer**: `api/` or `tools/` - FastMCP tool implementations
- **Service Layer**: `services/` - Business logic, protocol-agnostic
- **Repository Layer**: `repositories/` or `data/` - Database access abstraction
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/` per testing strategy

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
Basic setup needed for future Epic and Story entities:
- Epic: id, title, description, status
- Story: id, title, description, acceptanceCriteria, status
- Artifact: id, uri, relation

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- Service Layer: Define custom exceptions for business logic failures
- API/Tool Layer: Translate exceptions to standard MCP errors with appropriate codes (-32001) and messages
- Keep business logic protocol-agnostic

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Framework**: Pytest ~8.2.2
- **Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/unit/`
  - Test server initialization process in isolation
  - Mock API/Tool layer, use in-memory SQLite for repository tests
  - Focus on Service Layer and Repository Layer functions
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/integration/`
  - Test Service-Repository interaction with dedicated temporary SQLite database
  - Each test runs in transaction rolled back after completion
- **E2E Tests**: Located in `tests/e2e/`
  - Launch server as subprocess using pytest fixture
  - Test JSON-RPC via stdin/stdout with stdio transport
  - Validate stdout contains only valid JSON-RPC responses
  - Verify logging output directed to stderr
  - Test full MCP client simulation for initialization flow

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-26
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Excellent foundation implementation** with solid architectural patterns and comprehensive test coverage. The developer correctly followed the 3-layer architecture guidelines and implemented a clean, minimal viable solution for service initialization. The code demonstrates good understanding of MCP protocol requirements and proper error handling patterns.

### Refactoring Performed
**File**: main.py
- **Change**: Enhanced error handling and logging infrastructure
- **Why**: Original implementation used basic print statements to stderr; improved version uses Python's logging module for better observability and maintainability
- **How**: Added structured logging with timestamps, proper log levels, and consistent formatting; improved exception handling with specific handling for KeyboardInterrupt vs other exceptions

**File**: tests/unit/test_server_initialization.py
- **Change**: Enhanced test coverage for improved error handling and logging
- **Why**: Tests needed to cover the new logging functionality and KeyboardInterrupt handling
- **How**: Added tests for create_server failure scenarios, KeyboardInterrupt graceful shutdown, and proper logging verification using mocks

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Clean, well-documented code with proper type hints and docstrings
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect adherence to 3-layer architecture with appropriate directory structure
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests covering all critical paths (9/9 tests passing)
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Enhanced logging infrastructure for better observability (main.py)
- [x] Improved error handling with specific KeyboardInterrupt handling (main.py)
- [x] Added comprehensive test coverage for new functionality (test_server_initialization.py)
- [x] Verified all 9 unit tests pass after refactoring
- [x] Ensured proper stderr logging to avoid stdout JSON-RPC contamination

### Security Review
**No security concerns identified.** The implementation correctly:
- Isolates error output to stderr to prevent JSON-RPC contamination
- Uses secure default configurations
- Follows principle of least privilege with minimal required dependencies

### Performance Considerations
**Implementation is performance-appropriate** for initialization concerns:
- Minimal startup overhead with FastMCP SDK
- Proper async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Clean resource management in finally blocks

### Final Status
**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation exceeds expectations for a service initialization story. The developer delivered a solid foundation that correctly implements all architectural requirements with excellent test coverage. The refactoring performed during QA review enhances the production-readiness of the code without changing core functionality. All acceptance criteria are met and the solution is ready for the next development iteration.
