# Story 0.1: Project Structure Refactor

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to refactor the project structure to follow standard Python conventions,
**so that** the codebase is more maintainable, scalable, and easier for new developers to understand.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `src/agile_mcp` directory is created to house all source code.
2. All existing Python source files and packages (`main.py`, `api/`, `services/`, `repositories/`) are moved into the `src/agile_mcp` directory.
3. The `src/agile_mcp` directory is a proper Python package (contains an `__init__.py` file).
4. All import statements in both the application source code and the test suite are updated to work correctly with the new structure.
5. All existing unit and integration tests pass successfully after the refactoring.
6. Development environment tooling (linters, formatters, etc.) in `.vscode/settings.json` is updated to correctly recognize the new source path.
7. Relevant project documentation (e.g., `docs/architecture.md`) is updated to reflect the new `src/agile_mcp` structure.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create New Directory Structure** (AC: #1)
  - [x] Create the `src/agile_mcp` directory.
- [x] **Task 2: Move Source Code** (AC: #2)
  - [x] Move `main.py` to `src/agile_mcp/main.py`.
  - [x] Move `api/` to `src/agile_mcp/api/`.
  - [x] Move `services/` to `src/agile_mcp/services/`.
  - [x] Move `repositories/` to `src/agile_mcp/repositories/`.
- [x] **Task 3: Create Python Package** (AC: #3)
  - [x] Create `src/agile_mcp/__init__.py`.
- [x] **Task 4: Update Import Paths** (AC: #4)
  - [x] Systematically review and update all `import` statements in the moved application code.
  - [x] Systematically review and update all `import` statements in the `tests/` directory.
- [x] **Task 5: Update Developer Tooling** (AC: #6)
  - [x] Modify `.vscode/settings.json` to include the `src` directory in the python path.
- [x] **Task 6: Verify Changes** (AC: #5)
  - [x] Run the full test suite and confirm all tests pass.
- [x] **Task 7: Update Documentation** (AC: #7)
  - [x] Review `docs/architecture.md` and other key documents for any diagrams or code examples that need to be updated with the new file structure.

## Dev Notes
This is a structural refactoring. No application logic should be changed. The primary goal is to move files and update import statements to align with Python best practices. The dev agent must be careful to update all import paths correctly, especially within the `tests` directory, to ensure they point to `agile_mcp.services`, etc., instead of just `services`.

### Testing
- All existing tests must pass. No new tests are required for this refactoring, but running the existing suite is the primary validation method.
- Test files are located in `tests/`.
- The testing framework is `pytest`.

## Change Log
| Date       | Version | Description                | Author |
|------------|---------|----------------------------|--------|
| 2025-07-26 | 1.0     | Initial draft of the story | Sarah (PO) |
| 2025-07-26 | 1.1     | Completed implementation     | James (Dev) |

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
Gemini Pro

### Debug Log References
- Pytest output showing `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- Pytest output showing successful test run after setting `PYTHONPATH`.

### Completion Notes List
- The project structure was successfully refactored into a `src` layout.
- All source code was moved to `src/agile_mcp`.
- All import paths in application and test code were updated.
- The architecture documentation was updated to reflect the new structure.
- A `PYTHONPATH` adjustment was required to run tests, which is a standard practice for `src` layouts. This should be noted for CI/CD configuration.

### File List
**Modified:**
- `tests/unit/test_server_initialization.py`
- `.vscode/settings.json`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/stories/0.1.project-structure-refactor.md`

**Created:**
- `src/agile_mcp/__init__.py`

**Moved:**
- `main.py` -> `src/agile_mcp/main.py`
- `api/` -> `src/agile_mcp/api/`
- `services/` -> `src/agile_mcp/services/`
- `repositories/` -> `src/agile_mcp/repositories/`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-26
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The project structure refactor has been implemented with excellent attention to detail and follows Python best practices. The implementation demonstrates proper separation of concerns with a clean src layout. The code maintains good documentation standards and includes comprehensive test coverage.

### Refactoring Performed
No additional refactoring was required. The developer implementation was clean and well-structured.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All Python conventions followed, proper module documentation
- Project Structure: ✓ Standard src layout correctly implemented with proper __init__.py files
- Testing Strategy: ✓ All tests updated and passing with correct import paths
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Verified proper src/agile_mcp directory structure creation
- [x] Confirmed all source files moved correctly to new locations
- [x] Validated Python package structure with __init__.py files
- [x] Verified test imports updated to use agile_mcp.* paths
- [x] Confirmed VS Code settings updated with src in python.analysis.extraPaths
- [x] Validated documentation updates reflect new structure
- [x] Confirmed all tests pass with PYTHONPATH=src

### Security Review
No security concerns identified. The refactoring is purely structural with no changes to application logic or data handling.

### Performance Considerations
No performance impacts from this structural change. The import path changes have no runtime performance implications.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

All acceptance criteria have been met, tests are passing, and the implementation follows best practices. The story is complete and ready to be marked as Done.
