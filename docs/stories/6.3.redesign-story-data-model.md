# Story 6.3: Redesign Story Data Model

**Status:** ToDo

**Epic:** 6.0 Agent Workflow & Model Enhancements

**Story:**

**As a** Developer Agent,
**I want** the `Story` object I receive to be a rich, self-sufficient model,
**so that** I have all the necessary context to begin implementation without further queries.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The `Story` data model is extended to include:
   - `dev_notes`: A structured text field (e.g., JSON or Markdown) to hold pre-compiled architectural and technical context.
   - `tasks`: A list of structured task objects (e.g., `{"description": "...", "completed": false}`).
   - `comments`: A list of structured comment objects.
2. The database schema is updated to reflect these changes.
3. Existing story creation logic is updated to handle these new, optional fields.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**

- [ ] **Extend Story Data Model with Rich Fields** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add `dev_notes` field to Story model - structured text (JSON or Markdown)
  - [ ] Add `tasks` field to Story model - JSON array of task objects
  - [ ] Add `comments` relationship to Story model - one-to-many with Comment model
  - [ ] Add validation for dev_notes format (ensure valid JSON or Markdown)
  - [ ] Add validation for task object structure (description, completed fields)
  - [ ] Update Story model's to_dict() method to include new fields

- [ ] **Create Task Data Structure** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Define Task model or embedded JSON structure
  - [ ] Include required fields: description, completed (boolean)
  - [ ] Add optional fields: priority, assignee, estimated_hours
  - [ ] Create validation for task description (non-empty string)
  - [ ] Add task utility methods: mark_completed, get_pending_tasks

- [ ] **Update Database Schema** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create database migration for new Story fields
  - [ ] Add dev_notes column as TEXT or JSON type
  - [ ] Add tasks column as JSON type for task array storage
  - [ ] Ensure proper indexing for query performance
  - [ ] Test migration with existing story data
  - [ ] Verify backward compatibility with existing stories

- [ ] **Update StoryResponse Model** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add dev_notes field to StoryResponse Pydantic model
  - [ ] Add tasks field to StoryResponse model
  - [ ] Add comments field to StoryResponse model (from relationship)
  - [ ] Ensure proper JSON serialization of complex fields
  - [ ] Add optional field handling for stories without rich data

- [ ] **Update Story Creation Logic** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Modify StoryService.create_story to accept new fields
  - [ ] Add parameter validation for dev_notes format
  - [ ] Add parameter validation for tasks array structure
  - [ ] Ensure atomic creation of story with all structured fields
  - [ ] Add error handling for malformed structured data

- [ ] **Create Story Utility Functions**
  - [ ] Create helper functions for dev_notes formatting
  - [ ] Create task management utilities (add, complete, update tasks)
  - [ ] Create story context validation utilities
  - [ ] Add story completeness assessment functions
  - [ ] Create story serialization/deserialization helpers

- [ ] **Update Existing Tools to Support Rich Model**
  - [ ] Update backlog.getStory to return enhanced story data
  - [ ] Update backlog.updateStory to handle new fields
  - [ ] Ensure all story-related tools handle optional new fields
  - [ ] Add backward compatibility for tools expecting simple story model

- [ ] **Create Unit Tests for Enhanced Story Model**
  - [ ] Test Story model with dev_notes field validation
  - [ ] Test Story model with tasks array validation
  - [ ] Test story creation with structured data
  - [ ] Test story serialization/deserialization
  - [ ] Test task management utilities
  - [ ] Test error handling for malformed data

- [ ] **Integration Tests for Rich Story Workflow**
  - [ ] Test story creation with full structured data
  - [ ] Test story retrieval with enhanced data model
  - [ ] Test story updates preserving structured fields
  - [ ] Test backward compatibility with existing simple stories
  - [ ] Test database migration preserving existing data

**Dev Notes:**

**Context from PRD:**
This story transforms the Story data model from a simple entity to a rich, self-sufficient model that provides Developer Agents with comprehensive context. This eliminates the need for additional queries and improves agent autonomy and workflow efficiency.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use JSON fields for flexible structured data storage
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing simple stories
- Follow established patterns from existing data models
- Ensure robust validation for structured data integrity

**Dependencies:**
- **RECOMMENDED**: Story 6.1 (Project Entity) - Better context organization
- **RECOMMENDED**: Story 6.2 (Document Storage) - Rich context sources
- Foundation for Stories 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 (tools that consume rich stories)

**Rich Story Structure Design:**
```json
{
  "id": "story-123",
  "title": "Implement user authentication",
  "dev_notes": {
    "architecture": "Use JWT tokens with Redis session storage",
    "dependencies": ["user-service", "auth-middleware"],
    "technical_context": "Integrate with existing OAuth provider"
  },
  "tasks": [
    {"description": "Create User model", "completed": false, "priority": "high"},
    {"description": "Implement JWT service", "completed": false, "priority": "high"},
    {"description": "Add login endpoint", "completed": false, "priority": "medium"}
  ],
  "comments": [...] // From Comment relationship
}
```

**Validation Strategy:**
- Dev_notes: Validate JSON structure or Markdown format
- Tasks: Ensure array of objects with required description field
- Comments: Handled by Comment model validation
- Maintain flexibility for future structured data additions

**Self-Sufficient Story Criteria:**
- Contains comprehensive technical context in dev_notes
- Includes granular, actionable tasks for implementation
- Provides all necessary information without external queries
- Maintains clear structure for easy agent consumption
