# Sprint Change Proposal: Integration of a Formal Testing Strategy

## 1. Identified Issue Summary

**Problem:** The project currently lacks a formally documented and comprehensive testing strategy. While `Pytest` is listed in the tech stack, the specific methodologies for ensuring the reliability of the MCP server—especially regarding its unique client-host-server architecture and dual-transport (HTTP/stdio) nature—are not defined.

**Trigger:** This is a newly identified requirement, prompted by the need to ensure the service is robust and reliable enough for autonomous AI agents.

## 2. Epic Impact Summary

The introduction of a formal testing strategy does not invalidate any existing epics. However, it necessitates dedicated work to implement the testing framework and write the tests.

**Recommendation:** Create a new epic to house all testing-related implementation stories.

*   **New Epic Proposal: "Epic 4: Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance"**
    *   **Description:** This epic will cover the implementation of the testing framework, the creation of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all service features, and the setup of a continuous integration pipeline to automate testing.

## 3. Artifact Adjustment Needs

The following artifacts require updates:

1.  **`docs/architecture.md`**: This is the primary document to be updated. A new "Testing Strategy" section needs to be added.
2.  **`docs/prd.md`**: The "Technical Assumptions" section should be updated to reference the formal strategy in the architecture document.

## 4. Recommended Path Forward

The recommended path is **Direct Adjustment / Integration**. This involves updating the architecture document with the new testing strategy and adding the new epic and its corresponding stories to the backlog. This approach integrates quality assurance directly into the development lifecycle without disrupting planned work.

## 5. Proposed Edits to Artifacts

### 5.1. Proposed Addition to `docs/architecture.md`

I propose adding the following "Testing Strategy" section to `docs/architecture.md`, placed after the "MCP Server Implementation Examples" section.

## **Testing Strategy**

To ensure the reliability and correctness of the Agile Lifecycle Management Service, a multi-layered testing approach will be implemented using the **Pytest** framework. The strategy is designed to validate the service at the unit, integration, and end-to-end levels, accounting for the specifics of the MCP protocol and its transports.

### **1. Unit Tests**

*   **Scope**: Focus on individual functions and classes within the **Service Layer** and **Repository Layer**.
*   **Goal**: Verify that the core business logic (e.g., dependency validation, status transitions) and data access functions work correctly in isolation.
*   **Methodology**:
    *   The API/Tool layer will be mocked to isolate the service logic.
    *   The database will be mocked or an in-memory SQLite database will be used for repository tests to ensure speed and isolation.
    *   Tests will be located in `tests/unit`.

### **2. Integration Tests**

*   **Scope**: Test the interaction between the **Service Layer** and the **Repository Layer**.
*   **Goal**: Ensure that the business logic correctly interacts with the database via the repository pattern.
*   **Methodology**:
    *   Tests will use a dedicated, temporary SQLite database file to test real database operations without mocking the ORM.
    *   Each test will run in a transaction that is rolled back after completion to maintain a clean state.
    *   Tests will be located in `tests/integration`.

### **3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests**

*   **Scope**: Test the entire application stack, from the MCP transport layer down to the database.
*   **Goal**: Validate that the service behaves correctly from the perspective of an AI agent (MCP client), ensuring that JSON-RPC requests are handled properly and produce the correct responses and side effects.
*   **Methodology**:
    *   E2E tests will simulate an MCP client interacting with the running service.
    *   For the MVP, testing will focus exclusively on the **`stdio` transport**, as this is the primary communication method for locally hosted MCP servers.
    *   A `pytest` fixture will launch the server as a `subprocess`.
    *   The test will write JSON-RPC request strings to the subprocess's `stdin`.
    *   It will read from `stdout` to capture the JSON-RPC response and from `stderr` to check for logs.
    *   Tests will assert that `stdout` contains *only* the valid JSON-RPC response and that any logging output is correctly directed to `stderr`.
    *   Tests will be located in `tests/e2e`.

### 5.2. Proposed Change to `docs/prd.md`

In `docs/prd.md`, under the "Technical Assumptions" section, the "Testing Requirements" bullet point should be updated.

**Current Text:**
> * **Testing Requirements**: A comprehensive testing strategy is required, including **Unit, Integration, and End-to-End tests** to ensure the reliability of the tools provided to the agents.

**Proposed New Text:**
> * **Testing Requirements**: A comprehensive testing strategy is required, as formally defined in the "Testing Strategy" section of the **Architecture Document**. This includes Unit, Integration, and End-to-End tests to ensure the reliability of the tools provided to the agents.

## 6. High-Level Action Plan

1.  **Approve Proposal**: User to approve this Sprint Change Proposal.
2.  **Update Documents**: Apply the proposed changes to `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/prd.md`.
3.  **Create New Epic**: Create "Epic 4: Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance" in the backlog.
4.  **Draft Initial Stories**: Draft initial stories for Epic 4, such as "Set up Pytest framework and test directory structure," "Implement unit tests for StoryService," and "Implement E2E test for get_story tool via HTTP."

## 7. Agent Handoff Plan

*   **Product Owner (Current)**: Responsible for updating the official project documents (`architecture.md`, `prd.md`) and creating the new epic and stories in the backlog system.
*   **Developer Agent**: Will be responsible for implementing the stories defined in the new testing epic.
*   **QA Agent**: Will be responsible for reviewing the implemented tests and ensuring they meet the defined strategy.

This completes my analysis and proposal. Please review the "Sprint Change Proposal" above. If you approve, I will proceed with updating the documents.
